            "text": "A new security flaw has been found in robot vacuums, with researchers warning their laser-based navigation systems could be hacked to record private conversations.\nScientists at the University of Maryland’s Computer Science department have demonstrated a system they call LidarPhone, which can read vibrations in a robovac’s LIDAR laser navigation system generated by sound waves and use them to figure out the original sound.\nThe team successfully hacked into a Xiaomi Roborock vacuum and was able to take over its LIDAR system, allowing the scientists to control the beam and receive data from it without interfering with its navigation.\nThe researchers then captured signals bouncing off a variety of household objects as two different sound sources played – a human voice reciting numbers over computer speakers, and TV shows played through a sound bar – and fed them through deep-learning computer algorithms. They found that LidarPhone was able to identify and match spoken numbers, as well as the TV shows, with 90 per cent accuracy.

(Image: University of Maryland)\nAccording to assistant professor Nirupam Roy, the research reveals a security hole in devices we often welcome into our homes without a second thought.\n“We have shown that even though these devices don’t have microphones, we can repurpose the systems they use for navigation to spy on conversations and potentially reveal private information,” he said.\nRoy highlighted the risk of LIDAR-based spying being used to gather data such as spoken phone and credit card numbers from people working at home.\n“What is even more concerning for me is that it can reveal much more personal information. This kind of information can tell you about my living style, how many hours I’m working, other things that I am doing.\n“And what we watch on TV can reveal our political orientations. That is crucial for someone who might want to manipulate the political elections or target very specific messages to me,” he added.\nRoy warns that other devices, such as infrared sensors in smartphones and motion detectors, could be used in a similar way.\n“I believe this is significant work that will make the manufacturers aware of these possibilities and trigger the security and privacy community to come up with solutions to prevent these kinds of attacks,” he said. Sound waves captured by a robot vacuum. (Image: University of Maryland)\nCapturing sound using lasers is not a new technology, with laser microphones featuring in the kits of espionage agents since the 1940s. There is already concern from privacy experts that the maps generated by robovacs could be used to give advertisers data such as home size, layout, and other sensitive information.",

            "text": "A battle royal is set to break out after a proposed new Woolworths Metro store in Mosman was rejected with several options now open to the big retail group.\nAndrew Loveday, Woolworths Head of Property Development said “We believe we’ve put forward a proposal that is consistent with the planning framework. This was reflected in Mosman Council’s recommendation to approve the project”\n“While we’re disappointed with the result we’ll review the reasons for the Panel’s decision and explore our options”.\nMosman residents are now facing having to pay a million dollar plus legal bill after plans for a proposed small Woolworths Metro store in the affluent suburb was rejected this morning with the matter now tipped to head to the Land & Environment Court.\nThe last time the Mosman Local Planning Panel rejected a Woolworths application for a Woolworth owned Dan Murphy outlet it cost the Council over $600,000 in legal fees alone.\nThe Dan Murphy store is now one of the most popular retail locations in Mosman with none of the objectors claimed problems coming to fruition.\nInsiders are tipping that Woolworths will win their case in the Land & Environment Court after an independent report found that the proposed store met planning guidelines and that there was no real reason for the plans to be rejected.\nDespite a day of presentations yesterday the Woolworths development application was refused unanimously this morning by the Mosman Local Planning Panel.\nProtest Group who call themselves the Mosman Village Community which includes former Mosman Mayor Peter Abelson have mounted a major campaign against the proposal.\nMany in this group are the same people who objected to the Dan Murphy store which cost ratepayers hundreds of thousands of dollars, with money being allocated by the Council to fight questionable legal cases Vs the money being invested in child care.\nChannelNews understands that Council officals were expecting the proposal to be approved.\nThe Panel Chaired by Justice Stein voted unanimously to reject the Development on the following grounds:.\n1. The application fails to satisfy the Aims of the Mosman Local Environmental Plan 2012 in particular Clauses 1.2(2)(i) and (j).\n2. The application fails to satisfy the Aims of the Business Centres Development Control Plan 2012 in particular Clauses 1.5(e), (g) and (i).\n3. The application fails to provide adequate car parking for retail customers, staff, and service vehicles. In particular, the proposed car parking fails to comply with the requirements of Clause 6.11 of the Business Centres Development Control Plan 2012 and fails to comply with the requirements of the RMS Guide to Traffic Generating Developments.\n4. Access to and from the carpark from Lennon Lane is inadequate and will create traffic conflicts for users of the carpark, including delivery vehicles. In particular, the lane is narrow and the access to the carpark is also narrow. The application seeks to create a section of lane, where two vehicles cannot pass, behind the Mosman Club which will result in traffic queuing and congestion.\n5. The proposed entry and exit from the carpark and adjacent lane poses adverse outcomes for pedestrian safety.\n6. Lennon Lane itself is inadequate for access to the carpark and the proposed development.\n7. The proposed development is unsuitable for the site having regard to Section 4.15(1)(c) of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979.\n8. The proposed development is contrary to the public interest having regard to the above reasons for refusal and the overwhelming number of submissions from the public opposing the application (Section 4.15(1)(d) and (e) of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979).\nThis comes after objectors questioned demand for the late-night shopping, with resident Nicholas Calfas saying: “I doubt anyone on the applicant’s substantial team have been in Mosman past 6pm – the joy of this neighbourhood is that after 9pm it’s quiet.”\nThe planning panel found the development was permitted in the B2 Local Centre zoning of the site and there was no evidence the store would impact property prices or block views across Sydney Harbour.\nIn a statement, prior to the decision the retailer said it was “committed to delivering a Woolworths Metro to the Mosman community.”\n“We’ve listened closely to the community throughout the development of our plans and we’re pleased the development application has been recommended for approval by the council,” a spokeswoman said.\n“We believe we’ve put forward a proposal that is consistent with the planning framework and we look forward to a determination at the local planning panel.”\nMore to follow…",

            "text": "After much hype and speculation, Samsung has released the Galaxy S20 Fan Edition, or FE – a lower-priced entry point into the S20 range. Despite being the cheapest of the lot, though, the FE punches well above its weight as an alternative to its big brothers.\nDesign\nAesthetically, the S20 FE is a sophisticated-looking phone with a few key differences from the rest of the S20 line-up. The screen is flat instead of curved, while the polycarbonate back has a matte metallic finish rather than shiny glass. The hole-punch selfie camera sits right in the middle of the top edge of the screen, while the two buttons – volume rocker and programmable side button – are on the right-hand side.\nThe phone is available in the widest array of colours in the S20 range: navy, lavender, mint, red, orange, and white. Our review unit was navy, which I found to be a nicely elegant and understated colour scheme.\nMy one complaint about the FE’s design is the rear camera housing. It’s huge , and sticks way out from the back, making for a pretty jarring bump. When you consider that lower-priced smartphones like the TCL 10 Pro have managed to figure out how to make the camera array sit perfectly flush with the surface, it’s disappointing that Samsung can’t make its camera housings even a bit thinner.\nFeatures\nLet’s get this out of the way first: no, there is no 3.5mm headphone jack, with the only physical port being USB-C. I’m perennially disappointed when flagship phones leave this out – why do value and mid-range phones still have them, and yet premium ones don’t? – but I recognise this ship has probably sailed. Oh well. Le 3.5mm jack est mort, vive le buds.\nLike other Samsung premium phones, the S20 FE features an under-screen fingerprint sensor, which works just fine, though it’s optical rather than ultrasonic. There’s also the option for face unlock, which is fast and easy (though unfortunately less useful than it otherwise would be, in these masked times).\nOne thing that should have Samsung fans dancing in the streets: the side key can be natively mapped to get rid of Bixby entirely. While Samsung’s much-maligned answer to Google Assistant is still installed on the FE, you can at least divorce its function from the side key through an easy-to-access menu. Gone are the days when you accidentally hit the key and launch Bixby when you were meaning to do something else. At last.\nAs is rapidly becoming standard for premium and even some midrange phones, the S20 FE also offers a 5G model – though that’s not really news (at least for Android devices, anyway; I do note that Apple made a big song and dance about the iPhone 12 finally having 5G more than a year after the competition).\nPerformance and Display\nThe big news for the S20 FE: we here in Australia get the Snapdragon 865 processor, like the US, instead of our usual Exynos offering. You don’t even get Snapdragons in the rest of the S20 range, so this is a big step up for Samsung, and one they’ll hopefully continue with the S21 (or whatever they decide to call it). Comparable phones like the Pixel 5 and the LG Velvet only pack 765G chips, so the S20 FE already has a significant advantage when it comes to processing power, even if it only has 6GB RAM.\nSoftware-wise, the S20 FE ships with Android 10 and OneUI 2.5. One big plus for future-proofing: Samsung has guaranteed three generations of Android updates for all Galaxy S phones from last year’s S10 series onwards, so look out for Android 11 coming to the FE soon.\nThe 4500mAh battery is nice and robust, and supports up to 15W fast charging as well as wireless charging. A full day of use, including video streaming and camera, only ate through about half the battery, which is solid – though take this information with the knowledge that we had 5G disabled, and that tends to suck a battery dry a lot quicker. In any case, for the price point, this battery is a great deal.\nThe 6.5-inch Super AMOLED display is lovely – definitely up to Samsung’s usual high standard. Its 2400 x 1080 resolution puts it just above the comparable display from last year’s S10 lineup (the S10e, with its 2280 x 1080 5.8-inch Dynamic AMOLED screen), but honestly, it even stacks up pretty well against my S10 5G and its 6.7-inch 3040 x 1440 Dynamic AMOLED display. That might be partially thanks to its 120Hz refresh rate – a significant step up from last year’s 60Hz screens, which makes scrolling and swiping as smooth as silk. Absolutely no complaints here.\nThe flat screen is a departure from the higher-end waterfall displays on the other phones in the S20 range, but really, I don’t think much is lost between a curved screen and a flat screen anyway. The trade-off on price is probably worth it.\nCamera\nIn a word: exceptional. The rear three-camera array delivers crisp and sharp images in most lighting situations at 0.5x, 1.0x, and 3.0x zoom, with digital zoom going up to 30x. Though you naturally expect some image degradation at such high levels of digital zoom, the end result is still pretty good quality. The front selfie camera is also good – it may not be as versatile as the rear array, of course, but it does the job it’s supposed to, and does it well. Outside, at 1x zoom. Outdoor closeup at 3x zoom. Indoors – note the sharp and fine detail. Selfie camera! Taken in night mode.\nVerdict\nAt $999 for the 4G and $1099 for the 5G model, the Samsung Galaxy S20 Fan Edition is extraordinary for its price point. While you can pick up a 5G Google Pixel 5 for the same price as a 4G S20 FE, the Pixel 5 only comes with the Snapdragon 765G processor and a 4080mAh battery. If you’re looking to jump on board the Samsung train and want the phone that will offer the best bang for your buck: this is, unquestionably, it.\nPros",

            "text": "^^View important information Shameless on iTunes\nIf you want in on Gallagher action, but aren’t sure if you’re completely ready to be swept up in Chicago just yet (or aren’t ready to commit to a streaming platform subscription) then you may want to go old school and check out Shameless on iTunes. This may also be ideal if you have Apple TV. You can purchase individual episodes for $3.49 each, season one-eight for $34.99, season nine for $39.99 or season 10 for $37.99. Shameless on Google Play\nSimilarly to iTunes, you can also catch a few select episodes of Shameless here and there (maybe you just really want to watch the Gallavich wedding?) on Google Play. This may also be ideal if you have a Smart Android TV or Chromecast. On Google Play, you can purchase individual episodes for $2.99 each, or full seasons for a varied amount between $8.99 to $16.99. Advertisement What is Shameless about?\nIf you are yet to discover the marvel that is Shameless , then you’re in for a rude shock. The US adaptation of the British show by the same name, Shameless follows the Gallaghers — a clan of children born into poverty with an absent mother and an alcoholic father — who live on the rough streets of south Chicago. William H. Macy stars as the family patriarch, the unemployed, alcoholic and drug addicted disaster of a father who treats fatherhood the same way most of us treat laundry — an annoying chore. The ensemble cast and chaotic storylines means there’s never a dull moment, and perfect for bingeing. What can we expect in season 11?\nIn typical Gallagher fashion, season 10 ended in beautiful chaos; mainly with the union of Mickey and Ian with the Gallavich wedding we’ve been waiting years for. With Fiona gone, Debbie stepped up as matriarch of the Gallagher household, and Lip and Tami played will-they-won’t-they all season long. The creators are remaining pretty tight-lipped on storylines, but we’re expecting endgames to be revealed – Gallavich adjusting to married life, and maybe even a Fiona cameo. The filming of the 11 th and final season of Shameless was delayed this year, however it has finally been revealed it will premiere in America on December 6, so Australia should expect the series to hit our screens sometime early into the new year. Catch up on seasons 1-10 of Shameless\nThere’s never been a better time to play catch up on the Gallagher family, with the first 10 seasons of Shameless currently available on Netflix, iTunes and Google Play. That’s 122 episodes of Gallagher mayhem to keep you occupied while you wait for the 11 th season to hit Aussie screens. Where to watch Shameless UK in Australia\nYou can catch the first four seasons of the UK version of Shameless on iTunes or Google Play. On iTunes, you can purchase and download the first season for $17.99, seasons two-four for $18.99 and individual episodes for $2.99. Similarly, with Google Play you can purchase seasons one-four for varied prices from $17.99-$24.99 and individual episodes for $2.99.\nIf you’ve watched all 10 seasons of the US Shameless front to back while waiting for the next season, why not check out where it all started: Paul Abbott’s original UK series. Turns out the Gallagher family originated from Manchester, and they’re just as badly behaved (if not worse). Whichever series you decide to start with, you won’t be disappointed. Sign up to Disney+\nThere are two plan options to choose from – a monthly subscription at $8.99 per month, or prepay for a year at $89.99 and save on the monthly cost. Both plans include the same features, with unlimited downloads and the ability to stream on up to four screens at the same time.

            "text": "Researchers at the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom have developed a remote monitoring tool to help authorities manage safety in recently abandoned coal mines.\nThe tool, which can be used on a worldwide scale, uses satellite radar imagery to capture millimetre-scale levels of changes in terrain height, which can be used to monitor and forecast groundwater levels.\nThis technology can also be used to monitor changes in geological conditions deep below the earth’s surface in former coal mining areas.\nThe researchers found that when deep mines are closed, the groundwater that was previously pumped to the surface to make mining safe, can rise again until it is restored to its natural level via a process called rebound.\nThe rebound water needs careful monitoring as it often contains contaminants that can cause water pollution to drinking water supplies, flooding, land uplift and reactive geological faults.\nThe study lead and PhD student David Gee said the use of satellite radar and interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) could lead to the development of a cost-effective method to model groundwater rebound from surface movement changes.\n“InSAR measurements, when combined with modelling, can assist with the characterisation of the hydrogeological processes occurring at former mining sites,” Gee said.\n“The technique has the potential to make a significant contribution to the progressive abandonment strategy of recently closed coalfields.” Post navigation",

            "text": "Attacks seem to be aimed at infiltrating networks and burrowing deep into their infrastructure before deploying further attacks. Comments Credit: Dreamstime\nLast week, the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) issued warnings to Australian health-care providers that it had observed an increase in cyber incidents targeting the sector.\nThese attacks seem to be aimed at infiltrating networks and burrowing deep into their infrastructure before deploying further attacks.\nThe ACSC is tasked with improving Australia’s cyber security posture, and provides advice and support to help ensure Australia is a secure place to live and work. As part of its warning, the ACSC flagged the possibility of “ransomware” being deployed, which could disable critical systems unless a ransom is paid. In a hospital or other health-care facility, this could be a life-threatening situation.\nAttacks against the health-care sector are dangerous at any time. But when services are under pressure from COVID-19, and information-sharing (including tools such as contact tracing) is increasingly important, an all-out cyber attack against the health sector could be very damaging. The current threat\nThe ACSC guidance identifies two significant threats .\nThe first is the SDBBot Remote Access Tool (often referred to as a RAT), whereas the second is a ransomware tool named Cl0p. While neither is desirable, the combination of the two is particular concerning in a health-care setting. SDBBot Remote Access Tool (RAT)\nA RAT is a piece of malicious software designed to allow criminals to remotely access and control one or more systems in an organisation. Once run, the SDBBot RAT installs itself, downloads additional components and deploys the remote-access capability.\nOnce fully installed, criminals will often use a compromised computer to explore other systems – a technique often referred to as “pivoting”. As the criminals move through the network, they often take the opportunity to make copies of sensitive data. This can be a valuable asset to use for coercion, blackmail or even sell through the underground economy . Cl0p ransomware\nHaving the SDBBot RAT successfully deployed enables other attacks – one of the most concerning is that of ransomware . While not an inherent feature of SDBBot, a frequent consequence of infection is the subsequent deployment of the Cl0p ransomware .\nRansomware generally encrypts an organisation’s files or data so they are no longer accessible. Recovering the files typically involves paying a ransom, often in Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency.\nIn October, German company Software AG faced a US$20 million ransom demand after a Cl0p ransomware attack . In this incident, the criminals claimed to have more than a terabyte of stolen data, including emails, financial records and even scanned copies of passports. This data trove was published online when the company failed to pay the ransom. Screenshot of Cl0p Leaks website showing Software AG financial data available for public download (taken from dark web site).\nThis is an example of an increasingly common tactic referred to as “ double extortion ”, in which not only is data stolen and held to ransom, but there is the added threat the data will be posted in public or auctioned to interested parties. The threat of public exposure of the breach, coupled with the potential release of confidential data, can often encourage organisations to pay the ransom. Potential consequences\nA recent ACSC report on ransomware in Australia identified the health-care sector as the most targeted, by a significant margin. This is perhaps not surprising, given the sector’s lack of training , lax security practices and chronic underinvestment in technology and digital infrastructure. ACSC report on impacted sectors for reported ransomware incidents - October 2020. ACSC\nHealth-care providers face two significant consequences of cyber compromise. First, personal or sensitive data are valuable to criminals . Having such data leaked online is embarrassing and has significant legal implications for the organisation and the government.\nA second, more serious, consequence can be seen when a ransomware attack impacts critical systems. The most notable example in recent years was the Wannacry attack in 2017 that targeted the UK National Health Service , among others. Ransomware attack on UK hospitals.\nThe NHS suffered a major outage over several days following the Wannacry ransomware attack, resulting in thousands of operations and appointments being cancelled . Wannacry was estimated to have cost billions of dollars globally , with the UK NHS spending close to US$100 million to recover and strengthen its cyber defences . Screenshot of Wannacry ransom demand. Wikimedia\nA ransomware incident earlier this year in Germany had deadly results. When ransomware crippled a hospital in Dusseldorf, an emergency patient was sent to another facility instead. She died, and her death has been attributed to the delay in treatment.\nAustralia has had similar incidents in the past. Last year saw seven hospitals affected by a ransomware attack . Should we be worried?\nCyber attacks are a constant threat, and most organisations are well aware of the risks to their business operations, intellectual property, sensitive data and reputation.\nBut in the health-care sector the stakes are higher. Losing data can cost lives, and patient records being stolen is a breach of privacy that can have long-lasting effects for the patient .\nWith systems intertwined and dependent on each other, just one compromised target can have major implications.\nInterestingly, the Cl0p Leaks website (only available on the dark web through the TOR web browser) features the following reassuring statement in relation to hospitals - perhaps showing an ethical streak to the criminal group. Cl0p Leaks screenshot (taken from Dark Web site)\nCyber criminals are usually motivated by profit. Ransomware attacks work because individuals within organisations make mistakes. When combined, there is a strong motivation for criminals to continue these actions and for organisations (and us) to continue to pay to clean up the mess that’s left behind.\nBy Paul Haskell-Dowland , Associate Dean (Computing and Security), Edith Cowan University.\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

            "text": "Mideco’s Bat Booth 2.0 supports stricter dust regime for miners\nThe path to interoperability  —  the pinnacle of the smart mine   —  is paved with real-time operational data and analytics.\nData analytics is a virtual goldmine for mining operations, with initial cost reduction and productivity gains of an estimated 10 to 20 per cent.\nMoreover, it is projected that in an accelerated technology adoption scenario  —  involving the deployment of data analytics, robotics and other technologies  —  a mining operation can reduce its costs by up to 40 per cent. This article discusses how a mining company can benefit from actionable data, namely in an operation’s approach to maintenance and asset management.\nIt provides an overview of maintenance strategies and outlines the rewards of a future forward, real-time maintenance approach.\nImportantly, it reveals how mining companies can adopt a four-step implementation plan to predictive maintenance and become Industry 4.0-ready. The evolution of maintenance\nWhen it comes to asset management, there are five common maintenance approaches that can be applied to mine assets: reactive, preventative, condition based, predictive and prescriptive.\nFor critical assets, reactive maintenance is not strategic when a machine has already broken down.\nEquipment breakdowns are often costly on many levels —  downtime means productivity is affected, parts can be expensive and then there are the wasted outlays on labor and energy.\nFor this reason, preventative maintenance will help improve asset reliability, but it might not be effective, as there will still be unplanned downtime and costly repairs that could have been avoided.\nCalendar-based or scheduled maintenance is inefficient because 82 per cent of machine failures occur at random patterns.\nCondition-based monitoring is the first step towards adopting a future forward maintenance strategy.\nCondition-based maintenance is defined by its name  —  it’s the monitoring of machines while they are still running.\nData can be collected online through network connectivity to sensors or offline through operator rounds or other means, depending on the criticality of the machine.\nPredictive maintenance advances the condition-based approach further by using model-based anomaly detection. It relies on the online collation of sensing data and uses data analytics to predict machine reliability.\nThe ultimate level of maintenance, prescriptive maintenance, involves the integration of big data, analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence.\nIt takes predictive maintenance a step further by implementing an action to solve an impending issue, rather than recommending an action.\nFor example, prescriptive maintenance could be deployed to automatically reduce the speed of an autonomous haul truck in order to increase its life expectancy.\nA prescriptive maintenance system will be a cognitive system; it will have the ability to ‘think’ and can only perform at this level when there is interoperability. This is the maintenance system of the future: the heady end goal of industry 4.0. The digital transformation: A four-step plan\nThe most important factor in achieving efficiency is access to real-time operational data.\nThe application of advanced analytics in maintenance represents the fourth level of maintenance strategy: predictive maintenance.\nThis has been dubbed as predictive maintenance 4.0 (or PdM 4.0).\nThis level of maintenance can reduce the time required to plan maintenance by 20 to 50 per cent, increase equipment uptime by 10 to 20 per cent and reduce overall maintenance costs by 5 to 10 per cent.\nReaching this level of maintenance is achievable now, through a four-step implementation process. Step 1: Establish an operational data infrastructure\nThe first step is establishing an enterprise operational data infrastructure. For example, OSIsoft’s flagship product, the PI System, is an enterprise infrastructure that captures real-time data coming from sensors, manufacturing equipment and other devices and transforms it into rich, real-time insights, connecting sensor-based data to systems and people.\nThis first step is fundamental to providing insights for later analysis.\nNot only will a real-time operational data infrastructure help improve asset reliability, but having a single infrastructure in place will improve process productivity, energy and water management, environment, health and safety, quality as well as KPI and reporting  —  all of them taking advantage of the same operational data.\nThis is the base for all digital transformation strategy initiatives such as implementing a PdM 4.0 approach. Step 2: Enhance and contextualise data\nThis is how data is stored and enhanced to become information. Enhancing data means providing context to the data.\nFor example, even though data is collected from a sensor, analysts need to know if the equipment is running or has stopped either due to a failure or activation of an emergency stop button.\nSuch context provides data with meaning. Without context, data doesn’t have much value.\nAlso, recognising what data is important and relevant to an organisation is equally as vital.\nOSIsoft’s PI System provides businesses with contextualised data — the type of data that enables smarter operations. Step 3: Implement condition-based maintenance\nThis is about implementing condition-based maintenance (CBM) using contextualised data.\nThis involves prioritising certain assets, identifying the conditions that lead to an eventual failure, and implementing those conditions on specific assets within a real-time operational data infrastructure to automate condition-based monitoring.\nFor example, when a bearing temperature starts increasing outside of its normal operating temperature, it means the bearing will eventually fail.\nReal-time CBM implemented with the PI System can also take into consideration some basic analytics. F\nor example, identifying a performance pattern, such as an increase of bearing temperature by more than 20 per cent in the last seven days, would allow the maintenance strategy for this asset to become more and more predictive.\nReliability engineers already know a lot of those failure patterns, which are often found through reliability centred maintenance analysis following a failure.\nAll of those known patterns should then be implemented as CBM inside a real-time enterprise operational data infrastructure. Step 4: Implement predictive maintenance 4.0\nThis is the final step, the implementation of PdM 4.0.\nThe PI System  —  in conjunction with advanced analytics and pattern recognition tools  —  will provide real-time, actionable intelligence that empowers businesses to optimise their operations.\nUsed together, these tools will automatically determine the patterns that lead to an eventual failure.\nUsing the bearing example above, the question could be asked, what pattern causes the bearing temperature to start increasing out of its normal operating range?\nOnce implemented, this approach can significantly boost productivity and reduce maintenance costs. Case Studies Syncrude: Mining equipment event synthesis\nSyncrude is one of the world’s largest producers of synthetic crude oil from oil sands and operates two largescale surface mines using truck and shovel techniques.\nThe company wanted to apply event synthesis on their mining equipment for early intervention and to reduce costs.\nThis was a particularly challenging exercise as they run a 136-unit heavy hauler fleet with supporting equipment such as shovels, graders and dozers.\nThe manual analysis of truck sensor datasets proved too cumbersome for timely analysis and intervention.\nThey used the PI System to create a solution for the reporting of mechanical events that occur on the mobile equipment at the Syncrude sites.\nThey were able to optimise and streamline calculations and integrate these with notification systems as well as validate and tune performance.\nThis involved collecting data from 6600 data points on 131 heavy duty trucks and five shovels.\nThe results were impressive. Syncrude calculated that fleet operating expense savings came to $US16.75 ($23) per hour per unit, which equates to a $US20 million annual operating cost avoidance, not including lost production hours that would have occurred.\nUsing real time operational data, Syncrude was not only able to save on maintenance costs but also help improve their safety results.\nFrom a safety perspective, monitoring dumping procedures improved compliance and reduced non-procedural operator dumping incidents by 85 per cent. Barrick Gold: Real-time haul truck health monitoring\nThe largest producer of gold in the Caribbean, Barrick Gold Pueblo Viejo wanted to improve the asset health monitoring system of its haul truck fleet to improve maintenance efficiency and reduce costs.\nThe challenge involved providing real-time information of 34 haul trucks using installed systems and at minimum cost.\nPrior to installing the PI System, reliability and maintenance managers relied on incomplete or delayed information to make decisions.\nThe solution was to deploy the PI System to connect with the truck sensors and extract real-time operational data.\n“We used to use the in-vehicle sensors to investigate why a truck failure had happened,” explained Alejandro Zappa, a senior metallurgist for Barrick Gold.\n“Now we can be one step ahead of a failure and be more proactive.”\nBy using the PI System, Barrick Gold saved $US500,000 in the first half year of implementation by being able to detect and address failures before they occurred.\nThe company also reduced the total number of failures from engine, brake or suspension issues by 30 per cent. Barrick Gold: Turning data into gold\nHeadquartered in Toronto, Canada, Barrick Gold is one of the largest gold mining companies in the world. With mines in 11 countries, Barrick creates a wealth of data, tracking roughly 250,000 tags across the enterprise.\nFor over 20 years, Barrick has relied on OSIsoft’s PI System to drive insight, action, and substantial cost savings.\nThe mining giant has engaged the PI System to become what it calls a “gold price agnostic” operator by bringing production costs to the point where even large commodity price swings will not cause major disruptions.\nOne goal the company has accomplished with the help of the PI System: better predictive maintenance at its Cortez mine in Nevada. Extracting and refining that gold is a laborious, mechanically intensive process.\nThe machinery involved in that process is expensive, and so is downtime caused by mechanical failure.\nCortez is investing in predictive maintenance through IIoT and data analytics, using sensors and machine learning to detect potential equipment problems before they escalate into failure.\nTo gather information on assets that are not inherently IoT-enabled, Barrick uses sensors and vibration monitoring software from Petasense.\nMachine learning algorithms use frequently collected sensor data to generate an equipment health score, which can be tracked for declines that might indicate a potential problem.\nSite engineers use PI System tools to integrate Petasense data with other sources and to provide clear, intuitive access to that data for a variety of users.\n“We’ve reduced unplanned downtime and repair costs, and improved the overall efficiency process,” said Deb Dewald, Barrick Cortez’s PI administrator.\nSince its inception in 2018, the predictive maintenance project at Cortez has begun to pay off quickly. The first potential defect was identified within a month of the project launch.\nSince then, more than half a dozen major equipment failures have been avoided. A single early fault detection for one piece of equipment alone saved the company $US600,000. Summary\nPredictive maintenance is the use of advanced analytics in maintenance and can provide impressive benefits for a mining operation.\nFor example, a mining equipment supplier is now able to sell predictive maintenance services on the assets it is selling, thus enabling a new business model for the company.\nTo implement PdM 4.0, companies need real-time operational data infrastructure to collect, analySe and implement data analytics. This is achievable with the PI System.\nCompanies can benefit from reduced costs as well as open new revenue streams, extend equipment life and increase their production throughput with the PI System.

            "text": "In the fourth quarter. Nvidia shares declined nearly 3 percent after company executives said data centre chip sales would fall slightly in the fourth quarter. The dip came after the Santa Clara, California company forecast overall fourth-quarter revenue above Wall Street expectations, betting on robust demand for its graphic chips for gaming devices and data centers. The chipmaker said it expects current-quarter revenue of US$4.80 billion (A$6.58 billion), plus or minus 2 percent, compared with analysts' average estimate of US$4.42 billion (A$6.06 billion), according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Nvidia also beat revenue expectations for the third quarter as gaming business revenue jumped 37 percent to US$2.27 billion from a year earlier, beating FactSet estimates of US$2.06 billion. But CFO Colette Kress said that \"industry-wide capacity constraints\" meant it could be months before supplies of Nvidia's newest line of gaming chips could catch up with demand. Besides high-end gaming devices, Nvidia's graphics chips are used in data centers to speed up computing for artificial intelligence work such as image recognition, which helped it eclipse rival Intel Corp's market capitalisation earlier this year. Revenue from the data center segment more than doubled to US$1.9 billion, compared with FactSet estimates of US$1.84 billion. Nvidia shares dropped after Kress told investors on a conference call that data centre revenue would decline in the fourth quarter. The company said revenue from Mellanox, the Israeli networking chip firm it acquired last year, contributed \"approximately a third\" of data center segment revenue in the third quarter, but that some of the growth came from sales to an unnamed Chinese customer that would not repeat in the fourth quarter. In September, US officials put into effect new restrictions on Huawei Technologies that blocked it from buying chips from US companies indefinitely, prompting the Chinese firm to stockpile chips. In an interview, Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang did not name the Chinese customer that made the \"unusually large\" third-quarter purchase but said there was no legal barrier to the customer resuming purchases in the future. \"It has nothing to do with regulatory issues,\" Huang told Reuters. Earnings per share were US$2.91, above analyst estimates of US$2.57, according to Refinitiv data. Earlier in October, Nvidia laid out a multi-year plan to create a new kind of chip for data centres, looking to grab a bigger share of growing data centre chip market.",

            "text": "Took unclassified technical information on a personal trip to China. An electrical engineer who worked for Raytheon Missile and Defense was sentenced to 38 months in prison after pleading guilty to violating US export control law, the US Justice Department announced. The department said that Wei Sun, 49, a Chinese national and naturalised US citizen, worked for the Raytheon unit in Tucson, Arizona, for 10 years. Lawyers for Sun did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Sun's case is the latest in a lengthening list of prosecutions launched by the administration of President Donald Trump related to alleged Chinese spying and technology theft. On Wednesday, an official confirmed to Reuters a report by the Axios website that US director of national intelligence John Ratcliffe was planning soon to \"describe in granular detail\" US intelligence findings regarding China's \"nefarious actions inside the US.\" The Justice Department said that while employed with Raytheon, Sun had access to defense technology information whose export is prohibited under American and international arms export laws and rules. Prosecutors said that between December 2018 and January 2019, while on a personal trip to China, Sun brought along unclassified technical information in a company-issued computer which included material related to a missile guidance system covered by US export controls. Prosecutors said Sun knowingly transported the data to China without an export license in violation of US laws and regulations. On February 14, 2020, Sun entered a guilty plea to charges related to the illegal export of defence data stored in a Raytheon laptop related to an advanced medium range air-to-air missile system. Prosecutors said Sun was arrested on January 24, 2019 en route to Tucson Airport for a flight connection to China, and that he later admitted his intention was to enroll in a Chinese university.",

            "text": "Australia’s biggest companies are formulating what a return to physical office spaces will look like and what the change in work culture means for underlying technology systems.\nMany expect to adopt a “hybrid” approach that mixes working from home or an office environment on a permanent basis, though there are significant variations between companies.\nTelstra has had flexible working arrangements in place since March 2014 - affording it a head-start when it came to dealing with Covid.\nBut, like other companies with large communal office spaces across Australia, it is examining how the future of work will look.\n“We’re planning what the future workplace experience will be for all of our people and this will be based on what they’ve said is most important to them,” Telstra’s Group Owner for Next Gen People Practices Julian Clarke told iTnews.\n“For example, our people have said they would prefer to work from home around three days per week, compared to an average of 1.7 days prior to Covid, and the main reasons they would come into an office would be for social interactions and team collaboration so we’ll design our approach and our workplaces with this in mind.\n“Around 90 percent believe they’re either the same or more productive working from home. The main reasons for this are no commute time, more flexibility with how they work, fewer distractions, and more time for exercise.\n“As we plan our future workplace into 2021 and beyond, we’re also looking at what tools our people will need and making sure we create a consistent experience across all our locations - in Australia and internationally.”\nClarke said Telstra anticipates the ‘new normal’ working environment to be “flexible, safe, geographically dispersed, and offer a hybrid of digital and physical tools and spaces that are tailored to an individual’s role and their technology needs, preferences and expectations.”\n“Work will be something you do, not somewhere you go. This won’t be a one size fits all approach – we want our people to choose to work in a way that best suits them.”\nClarke also said Telstra would invest in leadership and internal culture to support the permanent changes to ways of working.\n“We’re investing significantly in change management and upskilling leaders in areas like virtual teaming (although many of our leaders already operated with geographically diverse teams),” he said.\nTelstra also plans to use emerging technology to try to replicate some of the social and collaborative aspects of workplace culture that might otherwise be lost when employees spend a lot of time working remotely.\n“The opportunity now is how we use technology to help fill the void of our need for rituals and connections in a physical workplace,” Clarke said.\n“There are many technology opportunities to enhance remote working and make us feel like we are together. Many require more bandwidth, so 5G will become very important.\n“For example, 360 degree cameras and VR glasses will create a feeling we are sitting in the same room. It might look a bit awkward to see each other wearing VR headsets, but it can be fixed.”\nFor people that do come into the office, Telstra has created a ‘myWorkplace app’ that “gives people the ability to book a desk before they come in ... so that we can maintain social distancing.”\n“We’ll also add functionality next year so teams can book spaces to connect and collaborate in an office,” Clarke said.\nLike Telstra, ANZ Banking Group has similarly agreed that the majority of staff will work flexibly “in a blended way - a couple of days each week in an ANZ workplace and a couple of days working remotely,” deputy CEO Alexis George told iTnews.\n“There will be some teams or role-types that are best suited to working most of the time in an ANZ workplace due to the work they do and others that are better suited to working mainly remotely,” George said.\n“The level of flexibility each person will have is anchored to the type of work they do and what works for their team.”\nWilson Group - best known for its car park and site security businesses - is in the process of redefining its use - and need - for office space.\n“The actual office itself is undergoing a bit of a review,” chief information officer Jamie Newman told a recent Comscentre webinar.\n“We're starting to change our approach, so instead of having one big central office in the middle of the city, do we have satellite offices spread around where if people need to go in a day a week or just need to engage, rather than having to make the big haul into the city they just drop into one of the local offices and jump onto one of the collaboration platforms?”\nNAB has been busy deploying technology systems to aid its own staff in their transition to a hybrid work environment.\nThe bank has been preparing for a partial return to the office for several months, and has gone down the same path as Telstra in standing up an app that lets staff book desks to use .\nIn a recent Medium post , however, NAB’s tech team said it was working to improve the security of devices used remotely, and to make it easier to ship devices to new starters at the bank.\n“Using a compatible Windows 10 laptop, colleagues will be able to enjoy almost instant login using facial recognition, both increasing security on devices and also providing a more convenient and faster login experience,” it said.\n“We will [also] be shipping new PCs to new starters directly. The entire set up process then takes place over the cloud (online) - ordering, software setup, updates, and issues resolution are all done remotely and immediately.”\n",

            "text": "ASX-listed telecommunications services provider 5G Networks has acquired a data centre in Brisbane.\nThe facility, acquired from Pipe Networks, adds support for 250 racks and access to 3 megawatts of power on a dual power grid for redundancy.\n5GN paid $1.1 million for the data centre, including all operating infrastructure at the facility, using funds from existing cash reserves plus a “generous” rent free period as part of the 10 year lease.\n“We are really excited to be exploiting our advantage of being a data centre operator and fibre network owner, I haven’t seen rack space and dark fibre product bundling from one provider before, but this is what our customers are asking for,” 5G Networks managing director Joe Demase said.\n“It allows our partners to grow with a fixed cost model which also includes easy migration as a result of our 6 month rack offer.”\n5GN said the acquisition would allow customers to connect directly to the data centre through its dark fibre network once the new rollout is completed.\nThe new data centre increased 5GN’s total capacity to more than 1000 racks across Australia, and would also accelerate the expansion of the company’s wholesale channel strategy for infrastructure and data centre services. The expansion into Brisbane also extends the 5G Cloud solution geographically. Copyright © CRN Australia . All rights reserved. Tags:",

            "text": "ABB has developed an enhanced modus operandi that accelerates the detection and resolution of equipment failures at remote mine sites. Safe to Work explores the wonders of ABB Ability Remote Insights. Th e mining sector is embracing new ways of working, with progress in this direction accelerating across the world. While Australia’s mining companies are already at the forefront of technology that enhances remote work, this year has reinforced that it is a top priority. ABB service manager Thomas Stur has observed a definite uptake in the company’s remote operation diagnostic capabilities, called the ABB Ability Remote Insights, as mining companies seek to become more connected. The remoteness of Australian mines compared with those in other countries has conveniently positioned them as an early adopter of remote technology. ABB, a leading global engineering company that connects software to its electrification, robotics, automation and motion portfolio, has existing contracts with companies it supplies its products to, and that includes 24/7 remote support through its ABB Ability Collaborative Operations Centre. The company has contributed to the sector’s transition to remote work for over a decade. “The use of remote insights has been accelerated this year because we haven’t been able to get to site, so we have been using remote insights and other ABB Ability technologies to enable our engineers from Finland, Switzerland and the United States to dial in and assist on-site workers and engineers to solve problems they’ve encountered on our machinery,” Stur tells Safe to Work . “It’s the same customers we’ve been supporting for many years in Australia, but the appetite for using these technologies has definitely increased. “We rolled out ABB Ability Remote Insights in October 2019 so we’re lucky to be able to support our customers even when it’s not safe to go to sites.” Such remote work has been called on to comply with travel restrictions, but also to assist operators in resolving issues that would affect the safety of daily activities. ABB service manager Thomas Stur. Stur says a gearless mill drive could experience an abnormal rise in temperature and the operator may not know whether there is an underlying problem, or if it is simply a reaction to hot weather. ABB Ability Remote Insights is at the operator’s disposal for quick remote support 24 hours a day without having to wait for an email response. The company’s engineers will then use augmented reality (AR) to investigate issues as they arise before they turn into something major. “You don’t have to take the guesswork when maintaining large industrial equipment. You don’t have to take risks when you don’t need to. Instead, you can dial in and access assistance from the experts that designed your equipment,” Stur says. ABB Ability Remote Insights are delivered via a headset worn by both the ABB technician and mining operator. The technician can see what the latter sees, annotate on the image and provide step-by-step guidance as part of seamless two-way communication. “AR is where you overlay the real world with additional information. It is, by far, the most common technology at the moment and is being used by ABB extensively in Australia,” Stur says. “This gives operators the ability to escalate a problem as it arises. You retain a clear line of sight to your equipment and surrounding while receiving support.” Such mode of troubleshooting is built with safety in mind for it doesn’t require an operator to be caught up and look down at their tablet or mobile phone and be oblivious to an incoming danger in their surroundings. To Stur, this is the most important point of differentiation between AR and virtual reality (VR) as the latter works by blocking one’s view in real life. The AR technology doesn’t neglect the importance of personal protective equipment (PPE) either. It comes with full hearing protection modules so that an operator can hear the technician while remaining protected in a hazardous environment. “Mines of today are better connected than ever. 4G and 5G networks are set up in a lot of mines, facilitating the smooth utilisation of ABB Ability Remote Insights,” Stur says. “Everyone’s also very tech-savvy so we haven’t had any major issues in companies’ adoption of ABB Ability Remote Insights. After all, we live in the age of smartphones.” ABB Ability Predictive Maintenance for mining is also proactive for alerting operators before they can see an issue coming. Equipment receive 24/7 monitoring on the back of automated artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms that predict failures before they occur, stopping an issue from turning into a major failure. This is part of the ABB Ability suite, which encompasses a different range of capabilities around predictive analytics. Such is the masterful use of technology that ABB has decided to roll out its next technology. ABB is working to incorporate AR and mixed reality to create remote training, targeted to operators of ABB gearless mill drives. The prospects of a cross-over between AR and mixed reality have proven so well that ABB is also working on building remote factory acceptance test (FAT) capabilities to support the mining sector. A customer who wants to purchase equipment, but can’t travel to the factory to inspect it before shipment can choose to dial in directly using AR and other technology to conduct a remote FAT. They can watch a demonstration of the equipment, ask for any further information or particular tests to be conducted, and they will be guided in every step of the process. With the development that is going on at ABB, the industry can see what the future of operational support will look like. This new slice of reality is being added to the equation without compromising safety.\nThis article also appears in the Nov-Dec edition of Safe to Work. Post navigation",

            "text": "Consolidates to single platform.\nFresh produce and grocery chain Harris Farm Markets has consolidated its HR and payroll systems into a single platform to manage its growing workforce.\nChief financial officer James Williamson said the retailer had expanded its use of Ceridian’s workforce management software Dayforce, implementing all modules in the suite including core HR, recruitment, learning, remuneration review and succession planning.\nThe upgrade, which went live in August, replaced separate systems for payroll and learning which had integrated with Harris Farm’s original Dayforce instance implemented five years ago.\nSpeaking during a virtual event hosted by Ceridian, Williamson said removing the disparate systems had created “a single source of truth” for the store and executive teams.\n“Cutting and slicing the data has always been challenging when you're integrating multiple systems,” he said.\nWilliamson said the upgraded system provided “fast and accurate data” that allowed the retailer to closely monitor if sales were up or down and how sales tracked against wages each day.\nThe software also supports compliance with wage regulations and calculating penalty rates for a workforce that is rostered to work around the clock in warehouses and stores.\nOn the employee side, staff interact with Dayforce through a mobile application to set their availability for shifts, check rosters and clock in and out for their shift.\nWilliamson said employee engagement has increased since the retailer added the extra modules, jumping from 500 staff accessing the system daily to 1200 unique logins each day.\nHarris Farm Markets has 2500 staff and has plans to grow rapidly as it opens new stores.\nThe Sydney-based retailer acquired its first Queensland store in September, using the platform to onboard 80 new staff virtually.\n“We have a lot of confidence [in Dayforce] as we scale. We've got grand, grand plans for growth in the next few years,” Williamson said.\n“With the increase in the number of employees and as things change in the pay environment, we'll be able to make changes within Dayforce to make sure that we stay compliant.” Copyright © iTnews.com.au .

            "text": "Hybrid approaches invite the use of new tech platforms.\nAustralia’s biggest companies are formulating what a return to physical office spaces will look like and what the change in work culture means for underlying technology systems.\nMany expect to adopt a “hybrid” approach that mixes working from home or an office environment on a permanent basis, though there are significant variations between companies.\nTelstra has had flexible working arrangements in place since March 2014 - affording it a head-start when it came to dealing with Covid.\nBut, like other companies with large communal office spaces across Australia, it is examining how the future of work will look.\n“We’re planning what the future workplace experience will be for all of our people and this will be based on what they’ve said is most important to them,” Telstra’s Group Owner for Next Gen People Practices Julian Clarke told iTnews.\n“For example, our people have said they would prefer to work from home around three days per week, compared to an average of 1.7 days prior to Covid, and the main reasons they would come into an office would be for social interactions and team collaboration so we’ll design our approach and our workplaces with this in mind.\n“Around 90 percent believe they’re either the same or more productive working from home. The main reasons for this are no commute time, more flexibility with how they work, fewer distractions, and more time for exercise.\n“As we plan our future workplace into 2021 and beyond, we’re also looking at what tools our people will need and making sure we create a consistent experience across all our locations - in Australia and internationally.”\nClarke said Telstra anticipates the ‘new normal’ working environment to be “flexible, safe, geographically dispersed, and offer a hybrid of digital and physical tools and spaces that are tailored to an individual’s role and their technology needs, preferences and expectations.”\n“Work will be something you do, not somewhere you go. This won’t be a one size fits all approach – we want our people to choose to work in a way that best suits them.”\nClarke also said Telstra would invest in leadership and internal culture to support the permanent changes to ways of working.\n“We’re investing significantly in change management and upskilling leaders in areas like virtual teaming (although many of our leaders already operated with geographically diverse teams),” he said.\nTelstra also plans to use emerging technology to try to replicate some of the social and collaborative aspects of workplace culture that might otherwise be lost when employees spend a lot of time working remotely.\n“The opportunity now is how we use technology to help fill the void of our need for rituals and connections in a physical workplace,” Clarke said.\n“There are many technology opportunities to enhance remote working and make us feel like we are together. Many require more bandwidth, so 5G will become very important.\n“For example, 360 degree cameras and VR glasses will create a feeling we are sitting in the same room. It might look a bit awkward to see each other wearing VR headsets, but it can be fixed.”\nFor people that do come into the office, Telstra has created a ‘myWorkplace app’ that “gives people the ability to book a desk before they come in ... so that we can maintain social distancing.”\n“We’ll also add functionality next year so teams can book spaces to connect and collaborate in an office,” Clarke said.\nLike Telstra, ANZ Banking Group has similarly agreed that the majority of staff will work flexibly “in a blended way - a couple of days each week in an ANZ workplace and a couple of days working remotely,” deputy CEO Alexis George told iTnews.\n“There will be some teams or role-types that are best suited to working most of the time in an ANZ workplace due to the work they do and others that are better suited to working mainly remotely,” George said.\n“The level of flexibility each person will have is anchored to the type of work they do and what works for their team.”\nWilson Group - best known for its car park and site security businesses - is in the process of redefining its use - and need - for office space.\n“The actual office itself is undergoing a bit of a review,” chief information officer Jamie Newman told a recent Comscentre webinar.\n“We're starting to change our approach, so instead of having one big central office in the middle of the city, do we have satellite offices spread around where if people need to go in a day a week or just need to engage, rather than having to make the big haul into the city they just drop into one of the local offices and jump onto one of the collaboration platforms?”\nNAB has been busy deploying technology systems to aid its own staff in their transition to a hybrid work environment.\nThe bank has been preparing for a partial return to the office for several months, and has gone down the same path as Telstra in standing up an app that lets staff book desks to use .\nIn a recent Medium post , however, NAB’s tech team said it was working to improve the security of devices used remotely, and to make it easier to ship devices to new starters at the bank.\n“Using a compatible Windows 10 laptop, colleagues will be able to enjoy almost instant login using facial recognition, both increasing security on devices and also providing a more convenient and faster login experience,” it said.\n“We will [also] be shipping new PCs to new starters directly. The entire set up process then takes place over the cloud (online) - ordering, software setup, updates, and issues resolution are all done remotely and immediately.” Copyright © iTnews.com.au .

            "text": "\nMinister for Environment; Disability Services; Electoral Affairs Joint media statement - Environmental offsets agreement a win for the Pilbara 19/11/2020 1:10 PM Page Content The Morrison Government has reached a landmark agreement with Western Australia to expand one of the nation's key conservation programs to better protect the unique Pilbara environment. The agreement means that the Pilbara Environmental Offset Fund will now be able to receive and deploy the environmental offset monies paid by industry under both State and Commonwealth environmental legislation. The McGowan Government established the Fund in 2018, and an implementation plan for the Fund, developed with Commonwealth input, was released in November 2019. The addition of Commonwealth offset funds will allow larger conservation programs across the Pilbara, including the 'nesting' of projects to improve habitat and reduce threats for nationally-protected species. Minister for the Environment Sussan Ley said the alignment will also provide a more streamlined one-stop process for proponents in delivering offsets under both State and Commonwealth regulation. They will now be able to engage with a single agency, the Western Australian Department of Water and Environmental Regulation, who administer the Fund, for delivery of offsets. \"The fund operates as a partnership between the Western Australian Government and Traditional Owners, conservation agencies, industry and governments to improve and restore ecological habitats impacted by development in the Pilbara region,\" Minister Ley said. \"Environmental offset contributions from proponents will be paid into the Fund and the money will be invested in projects to restore vegetation and habitat across the Pilbara over the longer term. \"The Fund will overcome challenges faced by approval holders in accessing and securing land to deliver their own offset projects, but will not reduce their obligations to meet conditions of approval for minimising and rehabilitating environmental impacts.\" Expansion of the program scope to include Commonwealth matters will also provide a larger and more certain pipeline of conservation funding to support regional employment outside the mining sector, including Aboriginal rangers and groups, bolstering Western Australia's Green Jobs Plan on the road to COVID-19 recovery. Western Australian Minister for Environment, Disability Services and Electoral Affairs Stephen Dawson said that the Pilbara Environmental Offset Fund will deliver strategic and landscape scale programs in an area where deploying project-by-project offsets have becoming increasingly hard due to the complex and overlapping land tenure arrangements, and landscape scale threats. \"The transparency of the fund's operation, the strong governance, the link to the publicly available offset register and the collaborative leadership and oversight of all sectors including Traditional Owners makes this one of the most robust offset models in Australia,\" Minister Dawson said. \"With the same governance now applied to State and Commonwealth offsets we can have great confidence in delivering real benefits on the ground and know this will be demonstrated and reported. \"We had anticipated at least $90 million of conservation investments via this program over the next 30 years. Increasing this by including the EPBC Act offsets will allow both State and Commonwealth values that exist in the same area to be protected and improved together and to a greater landscape scale.\" The Commonwealth and State Governments have been working on the approach for over twelve months together with progressing the renewal of the bilateral assessment agreement.

She rejoined the company in 2019 in an AP leadership role based in Singapore.\nClunies-Ross has also had executive operations roles at Oracle and Citrix in the region from her base in Singapore.\nThe company’s regional boss Andy Zook said Clunies-Ross had proven herself as a “transformation leader and a consistent results-driven achiever”.\n“She brings a wealth of experience in the creation and delivery of analytically-driven decision making that will underpin the next wave of Digital Transformation,” he said in a statement.\nIn the same statement, Clunies-Ross said the company’s focus would be on supporting organisations with their cloud-based digital transformations and continuing to bolster its Academic Outreach Program.\nThe program connects corporates with academia and learning resources to help democratise and educate executives on AI and analytics technology, according to Clunies-Ross who serves as a part time advisor to Macquarie University and Melbourne Business School.\n“As the lifeblood of businesses, it’s important in-house teams are deepening their knowledge of innovative analytics software and services, so they can work with their IT partners to fully maximise their data,” Clunies-Ross said.

The project is fully funded by the McGowan Government, and will be included in the Mid-year Review in December. New facilities will include an administration building with adjacent library and staff facilities, two kindergarten classrooms in an early childhood block, four general learning areas with 16 classrooms, and parking for staff and parents. The school has two new buildings delivered under the Building the Education Revolution program in 2011, which include three early childhood classrooms and a covered assembly area with an art room and a music room. These buildings will remain on the site. The redevelopment will replace the current school facilities, which opened in 1973.\nUnder a re-elected McGowan Labor Government, construction is expected to start late next year and will be staged to minimise the impact on the school during the rebuild. The project will support 60 jobs and is expected to be completed for the 2023 school year. ",

The draft Plan is the first to propose establishing a strategic aboriginal water reserve for local Aboriginal people, following the negotiation of similar arrangements in the successful Yamatji Nation Indigenous Land Use Agreement. The Derby Aboriginal Water Reserve will ensure water is reserved for Derby native title holders to use for economic development. The Department of Water and Environmental Regulation will consult further with traditional owners regarding the sharing and administering of the water reserve. The new Plan aims to: protect fresh groundwater resources from seawater intrusion on the Derby peninsula; secure an additional 1.2 gigalitres for future public drinking water supplies for Derby and surrounding communities; protect important environmental and cultural sites and values; and set new allocation limits and licensing rules that provide certainty for water users. The new Plan for Derby will replace the 1992 management plan and provides for the future sustainable use and development of groundwater resources in the Derby area. The public comment period is open until 5pm (WST) on Monday May 31, 2021. The draft plan can be found at https://consult.dwer.wa.gov.au/water-policy/derby-groundwater-allocation-plan/ ",

The list will be expanded and updated as the site is developed.\nFor more information, visit https://www.wa.gov.au/pipeline-of-work\n",

            "text": "\nMindy Kaling Welcomes Baby No. 2\nIs it time for Reese Witherspoon to begin an inventory of her personal favourite issues?\nMindy Kaling advised PopSugar on Wednesday, Nov. 18 that it is powerful for her to decide on the most effective child present she’s ever acquired. Indeed, the mom of two holds a particular place in her coronary heart for Oprah Winfrey ‘s incredible gesture after daughter Katherine arrived in 2017. But Witherspoon’s shock for Kaling’s son, Spencer, whom she secretly welcomed in September , takes the cake.\n“Listen, that gift from Oprah was pretty hard to top,” stated Kaling. “I will say that, and this is maybe unsurprising … Reese.”\nClearly, Witherspoon’s present must be fairly sensational to high Winfrey’s, and certain sufficient, it was. Plus, Spencer wasn’t the one beneficiary.\n“I felt like the minute I got back from the hospital, there was a gorgeous gift for Spencer, with beautiful clothes and toys,” Kaling stated. “And this is why you know a gift is from Reese Witherspoon—she also got my older kid something. My daughter, who didn’t do anything, got all these beautiful clothes and toys, too. And she sent us food, so we didn’t have to cook for four days. So, that’s to me just a very Reese Witherspoon-type present where it’s thoughtful but in a very macro way. Like, she really knows what’s going on in your life. That was impressive to me.” ",

It allows our partners to grow with a fixed cost model”,” CEO Joe Demase added. Read more 5GN ploughs ahead with Webcentral buy\nSince then, the data infrastructure and network services pursued Webcentral, and the remaining operation of what was Arq Group.\nThe acquisition initially faced opposition to the deal from financial services firm Keybridge Capital, which accused 5GN of “coercive” shareholder activity in a bid to the Australian Takeovers Panel.",

            "text": "Frost & Sullivan: Firewalls to drive network security market 19 Nov 2020 Twitter\nFrost & Sullivan’s recent analysis, Integration of Capabilities Transforming the Asia-Pacific Network Security Market, 2020, finds that enterprises’ heightened threats from criminal entities and state-sponsored actors are strongly encouraging them to adopt network security solutions.\nDriven largely by the firewall segment and integrated security appliances (ISA) segment, the Asia-Pacific (APAC) network security market is expected to reach $6.94 billion by 2024 from $4.75 billion in 2019, up at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.9%.\nHowever, the fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted the network security market, and its future growth will also be affected over the next one to two years as the market grapples to recover.\n“Going forward, security vendors need to continue fostering strong integration and collaboration with third-party vendors, to fortify and strengthen their in-house offerings and provide a holistic solutions portfolio,” says Frost & Sullivan information and communication technologies industry analyst Vivien Pua.\n“From a market segment perspective, the firewall segment is the largest and fastest-growing market due to rapid adoption of next-generation firewalls (NGFWs) across the region. Similarly, intrusion detection systems/intrusion prevention systems (IDS/IPS) is seeing an emergence of next-generation technology in the form of Next-Generation IPS (NGIPS) as it (NGIPS) provides greater granularity in security data, which allows for better network security management.\n“In addition, the secure sockets layer virtual private network (SSL VPN) segment is also expected to grow steadily over the next 5 years, as remote working becomes more prevalent in the region.”\nTo tap into the growth prospects presented by the network security market, vendors should focus on the following: Regional 5G Deployments: Partner with service providers to design a network equipped with a wide variety of advanced security safeguards. Need for connectivity amid remote working: Provide business continuity packages or emergency licensing models to help enterprises cope with the rising need for VPN. Business opportunities in China: Work with local clients wishing to expand their business outside China as vendors already have two sets of products compatible with both Chinese and international standards. SD-WAN with next-generation firewall features: Offer integrated products to meet market demand for robust and secure SD-WAN.\nIntegration of Capabilities Transforming the Asia-Pacific Network Security Market, 2020 is the latest addition to Frost & Sullivan’s Information & Communication Technologies research and analysis available through the Frost & Sullivan Leadership Council, which helps organisations identify a continuous flow of growth opportunities to succeed in an unpredictable future.

            "text": "The Australian Society of Viticulture and Oenology (ASVO) last night announced the Awards for Excellence winners for 2020. • 2020 ASVO Viticulturist of the year – Dr Mark Krstic • 2020 ASVO Winemaker of the year – Peter Leske\n2020 ASVO Viticulturist of the Year Mark Krstic is the managing director of the Australian Wine Research Institute (AWRI). Krstic has more than 23 years of experience in viticulture research, R&D leadership and executive management.\nHe holds undergraduate and post-graduate degrees in Agricultural Science from the University of Tasmania and an MBA from Mt Eliza/Queensland University. Krstic commenced his career in viticulture R&D at CSIRO, Merbein, where he conducted research on grapevine physiology, crop development and yield estimation. Since that time he has worked in key viticulture roles at the Victorian Government’s Department of Primary Industries, the Grape and Wine Research and Development Corporation (now Wine Australia) and the Australian Wine Research Institute, leading a range of R&D initiatives.\nHe currently chairs the Australian Wine Industry Technical Conference Inc., is a past President of the Australian Society of Viticulture and Oenology (ASVO) and graduate of the Winemakers’ Federation of Australia Wine Industry Future Leaders Program (2010). He has played a key role in smoke taint research and emergency response since 2006 and recently co-authored a book on soil health Healthy soils for healthy vines (CSIRO Publishing) with Professor Bob White. He is extremely passionate about the grape and wine sector and the outcomes science can deliver.\n“I’ve always been fascinated by all aspects of innovation in the viticulture and how that can influence what we are able to taste in the glass. I am honoured to be nominated by my peers as an ASVO viticulturist of the year finalist” said Krstic.\n2020 ASVO Winemaker of the year Peter Leske is Winemaker and Director at Revenir Winemaking in the Adelaide Hills, where he and a small team make a range of wines for diverse clients using an equally diverse list of grape varieties into even more diverse styles! He greatly enjoys the opportunities that this challenge offers for collaboration with other industry members, which he cites as one of the genuine strengths of our community.\nThroughout his career, Leske has sought to increase and share collective knowledge and expertise, through roles at the AWRI and SAWIA, and most recently by assisting members of the Hills region with the making, sensory assessment and interpretation of smoke impact on hundreds of small-lot wines from affected vineyards. This effort has also involved working with practitioners and researchers to implement and manage related longer-term projects, which he hopes will add much to the future understanding of the impact of fires in viticultural regions.\n“I am surprised and delighted to be nominated in 2020: I consider myself very fortunate to have worked with a vast range of talented people over my time in wine. They have generously given and taught me much and I value every opportunity to follow their lead and share as much as I can with those around me” said Leske.\nBrooke Howell, President of the ASVO said, “ There was a very high standard of nominees for the Viticulturist and Winemaker of the Year awards who have all demonstrated excellence in their field. It was very pleasing to see Mark and Peter recognised as very worthy winners this year, for their significant contribution and ability to inspire others around them”\nThe full list of award categories and winners are: • ASVO Viticulturist of the year Dr Mark Krstic, The Australian Wine Research Institute (AWRI) • ASVO Winemaker of the Year Peter Leske, Revenir Winemaking • ASVO Viticulture Paper of the Year Dr Rob Walker, CSIRO • ASVO Oenology Paper of the Year Dr Vanessa Stockdale, Accolade • ASVO Dr Peter May Award Dr Marcos Bonada, PIRSA-SARDI ASVO Award recipients are nominated by ASVO-appointed selection committees comprised of individuals who themselves are distinguished in the fields of viticulture and oenology and who demonstrate exceptional leadership ability and vision.

            "text": "The company has launched its beta program of Zerto for Kubernetes (Z4K), an extension of its Zerto Platform, to support next-generation, cloud native applications.\nOrganisations can now protect, recover, and move any Kubernetes application and its persistent data for accelerated deployment within their application development lifecycles.\nAccording to the company, by applying its always-on replication for backup, DR, and mobility capabilities for Kubernetes applications that utilise persistent data, Zerto is bringing its CDP and journaling technology to containerised applications, and making it available to customers who want to participate in the beta program.\nZerto for Kubernetes is also being made available for access by anyone, anywhere with a new hands-on lab running the Z4K beta code.\nFor organisations just starting out with a containerised strategy, the hands-on lab provides a simplified way to test drive Z4K in the comfort of a home or office at any time with no additional setup required, the company states.\nThe lab provides complimentary, on-demand training on how to set up, configure, and manage a Z4K environment.\nAccording to Zerto, the release comes against a backdrop of what ESG calls pervasive adoption of containers, illustrated in a recent survey in which 71% of respondents said they have deployed or plan to deploy container-based applications in a hybrid-cloud strategy.\nZerto states it's clear to see why 57% of respondents indicated multi-cloud support as one of the most important features when it comes to backing up their organisation’s container environments.\nSince Zerto announced its plans to extend its platform to support next-generation applications at ZertoCON in June, the company has seen a rapid increase in demand for Z4K globally.\nOrganisations such as IFDS are making Zerto an integral part of their development cycle to protect, recover, and move applications for accelerated software development and delivery, the company states.\nZerto director of product strategy Deepak Verma says, “An evolution has been happening in the IT landscape for some time now.\n\"Organisations want their applications updated as frequently and as granularly as possible. These continual updates require utilising microservices that often prove too big for the virtual machines.\n“Z4K provides all the unique functionality our customers love in the Zerto platform but for containerized Kubernetes applications and with the DevOps engineer in mind.\n\"That means backup, DR, and data mobility for Kubernetes applications can be part of an on-premises or cloud deployment and be easily integrated and managed without requiring every Kubernetes application to write its own solution.” Related stories:",

            "text": "Advertisement Advertisement\n“This isn’t a story about a famous musician, this is a story about a guy growing up” says Shawn Mendes, one of the most famous musicians in the world right now, in the trailer for his new Netflix Original documentary, Shawn Mendes: In Wonder. The doco, which follows Mendes over the course of his stardom, provides fans with an exclusive behind-the-scenes look into the life of the superstar; whether it’s touring, his personal life, or his struggle with fame. If you’re a Shawn Mendes fan, prepare yourself, and if you aren’t; you’re about to be. In Wonder hits Netflix on November 23. What is ‘In Wonder’ about?\nShawn Mendes needs no introduction. The musician rose to fame after the success of his 2015 album featuring the chart-topping single ‘Stitches’. Since then, Mendes has gone on to become of the most popular solo male artists, gaining fans all across the world.\nIn his first feature-length Netflix documentary, fans are granted an all-exclusive look into the life of the superstar; from intimate conversations on mental health, his struggle with fame, to behind-the-scenes footage of his worldwide tour and the physical demands that accompany it. The documentary also follows his childhood and his first encounter with fame, as well as never-before footage of his relationship with fellow singer Camilla Cabello — whom, according to Mendes in the trailer, is the muse for “every song I’ve ever wrote”.\nAccording to Netflix, “The documentary is a heartfelt look at a songwriter and performer wrestling with the pressures of stardom and the emotional tolls of coming-of-age while the world watches. Largely framed around his rise and recent tour, the film offers unprecedented access to Mendes’ private life both at home, and while traveling across North and South America, Europe, Asia and Australia, and features years of footage as he rose from precocious troubadour to global superstar.”\nCatch boy wonder superstar Shawn Mendes’ doco In Wonder when it hits Netflix on November 23.

            "text": "The .au Domain Administration (auDA) has announced its board has approved new rules for the .au domain and its associated namespaces, set to launch in April 2021.\nThe rules, first proposed in 2018 , were designed to better meet the evolving needs of registrants, boost trust and security in the .au domain and keep it Australian-owned. The new rules also streamlined and simplified more than 30 policies and guidelines currently govern the .au domain.\nThe changes include: eligibility and allocation rules for some namespaces (e.g. com.au, net.au, org.au and asn.au); the terms and conditions for .au domain names; the complaints process; and how auDA manages compliance with the rules.\n“I’m pleased to share that the new .au domain licensing rules will launch on 12 April 2021,” auDA chief executive Rosemary Sinclair said.\n“This signifies an important step forward in .au governance – modernising the policy framework, ensuring the .au domain can respond to the changing needs of Internet users, and continuing to build trust and confidence in .au namespaces.”\nThe organisation has also worked on how the new rules would be implemented throughout the year, and training for registrars are set to start “shortly” to help understand and apply the new rules and inform the relevant changes to their customers.\nThe rules still do not include the id.au namespace, second level names and internationalised domain names, which are expected to come into effect in the next phases.\nFor .au domain name licences expiring after 12 April 2021, the previous rules will apply until the end of the current licence period, with the new rules applying from when the new licence period commences.\n“The new rules are the result of close engagement and consultation with stakeholders. I thank everyone who provided their valuable insights, as well as our community of accredited .au registrars, which will be crucial to the successful implementation of the new rules,” Sinclair added.

            "text": "The rise of DevSecOps comes at a time when IT leaders are faced with an increasingly active cyber threat landscape, coupled with higher consumer expectations of digital offerings and application usage due to a sharp increase in online activities, the report shows.\nHowever, a majority of APAC organisations are not equipped to tackle the issue at hand, with 55% of the respondents ranking modest to low in terms of their DevSecOps maturity levels.\nAPAC businesses encounter barrier to entry\nAccording to IDC, today’s businesses recognise that efficient software development, security threats, and business agility as the top drivers of DevSecOps initiatives in APAC.\nHowever, the survey found that while there is awareness of the benefits of engaging in DevSecOps practices amongst IT leaders, many obstacles remain on the path to the full adoption.\nOn a regional scale, only four in ten APAC leaders say they have united their DevOps and security teams to improve software development, with India (53%) and China (51%) leading integration efforts.\nDevSecOps adoption is still in the early stages for Korea (29%) and Japan (30%).\nToday, an organisation’s DevSecOps maturity level is intricately linked to its people, processes and tools - looking at stakeholder buy-in, approach to secure DevOps, and the technology used in testing and automating processes, the researchers state.\nFindings from the study reveal that the top obstacles to DevSecOps adoption are spread across the following three pillars: budget issues (15%), dearth of talent or skills (13%), and difficulty automating across hybrid infrastructures (13%).\nOvercoming these obstacles is a priority for APAC organisations as the need for software-powered innovation rises, which translates to a greater scrutiny on application digital risks.\nThe notion of late-stage security testing in software development is proving to be outdated in the context of today’s digital economy, where secure applications, services and platforms are the cornerstone of digital innovation, the report states.\nThe current state of security teams\nAmongst APAC organisations, DevOps teams are still primarily responsible for application security testing, followed by security teams.\nThe most common security tools currently in use are software composition analysis (24%), followed by interactive application security testing (19%), and static application security testing (18%).\nIDC Asia/Pacific DevOps research lead Gina Smith says, “The pressure to fully embed security into the continuous delivery pipeline signals a major shift towards a stronger DevSecOps culture, characterised by the abandonment of siloed functional teams in favour of shared responsibilities between developers and security experts.\n\"This is a strong step in the right direction for organisations looking to adopt an end-to-end security approach and build better digital capabilities.\"\nDevSecOps adoption at core of digital initiatives moving forward\nMicro Focus president Asia Pacific and Japan Stephen McNulty says, “Moving new digital initiatives forward quickly, especially to optimise the online experience for consumers and employees who are increasingly interacting with organisations virtually today, calls for secure and efficient software development processes.\"\n“This is a defining period for relationship and digital trust building, which means organisations will need to quickly speed up DevSecOps adoption through continuous and automated security testing to effectively respond to their stakeholders’ digital needs.”\nHe says, “The most holistic approach to DevSecOps that will play a key role in increasing organisations’ maturity level involves making security an integral part of every software development project, striving for 100% automated testing, and continuously analysing application performance for potential gaps.\" Related stories:",

            "text": "IKEA in Australia has finally embraced the mobile age, and won’t force you to navigate its stores if you want to buy its furniture.\nIKEA may well be the home of furniture with names you can’t properly pronounce, but it’s also a place known for its maze of a store layout. Almost like you were walking a furniture catalogue, IKEA takes you from one end of your housing layout to the next, showing you glimpses of what that world looks like from scene to scene.\nBut it’s also one that can actually get to people, particularly if they want one thing, but not to need to walk through the entire path just to find it, dodging people and kids as they walk. It’s almost like a theme park ride wait line, except with things for you to sit on and admire, checking the price tags as you do.\nIf you’re looking to skip the time it takes to navigate the varied IKEA walks, there are doors in between each section that allow you to skip parts, but Australians now also get one other way: an app.\nYes, IKEA Australia appears to finally be embracing the world of mobile apps, only after fixing its website in the past year or so to allow purchases with deliveries, something that was enormously helpful when the COVID lockdowns kicked in earlier.\nIt’s a slightly different story for the app, which does throw in a mobile shopping experience into the one place, but also includes product feeds curated for the home, and shopping lists that can be shared with the family. And important for the folks who want to avoid the IKEA maze, folks can use the app to buy and collect without entering the main of the store, or depending on where they are and how long they want to wait, have it delivered to them. That includes whether you’re looking at a lounge or a lighting system , bookcases or blinds , workstations or wireless chargers, or even IKEA’s take on Sonos speakers . IKEA’s smart lighting options\nIKEA Australia did tell Pickr that one thing that hasn’t made its way to the IKEA app is support for the augmented reality component, which exists in the IKEA Place app and allows people to digitally place select pieces of IKEA furniture in their homes to see how they work and fit in. While IKEA has the support in one of its apps, it isn’t in this app, at least not yet.\nIt did say that one upcoming feature would support customers to be able to skip the lines inside its stores, and scan the product in using their phone from on the store floor, buying it without needing to line up for the cash register.\n“The app provides a faster and smoother experience and importantly, lays the foundations for upgrades and enhanced features to be introduced in the coming months,” said Giovanni Rutigliano, Digital Manager at IKEA Australia.\n“We’re hoping the app provides an enhanced shopping experience for our customers, whether at home, on the move or in-store,” he said.\nThe IKEA app is available now for Android and iOS in Australia.

            "text": "City council in Queensland goes digital with Rubrik 19 Nov 2020 Twitter\nWith a population of over 150,000, Redland City Council covers six residential islands spread along the southern coast of Moreton Bay in South-East Queensland between Brisbane and the Gold Coast.\nIt has been at the forefront of innovation in the Sunshine State, launching the first on-road driverless bus trial in 2019, introducing an automated solar-powered compacting bin earlier this year, and releasing an app to promote local businesses by notifying users of deals and special offers when they’re near a store.\nThese initiatives underscore the Council’s desire to be a data-driven organisation and pursue a smart-city strategy designed to transform the way it delivers services to local residents and businesses.\n“Becoming a data-driven organisation was an absolute priority for us,” says Redland City Council CIO Glynn Henderson.\n“By using our data effectively, the possibilities are endless — we can improve internal efficiency, deliver strategic benefits, or drive greater economic, community, and environmental value.\n“We see our data as an asset. We need to have a cradle-to-the-grave view of it across the organisation so we can use it to make better decisions.”\nDespite the high business value placed on the Council’s data, Henderson’s small IT team would frequently lose days managing an ageing backup and data protection solution that was becoming prone to failure. Under the previous backup solution, approximately half a day each week was spent managing backups due to the distributed nature of the servers, then about another half day was often required to troubleshoot failed backups.\nWith the need to pursue more strategic IT initiatives, Henderson says he decided to implement Rubrik as it would not only ensure the integrity of its data and backups, it would also free up his team to work on more innovative projects.\nWhereas the previous solution demanded around 20% of a full-time employee’s capacity to manage, this has been reduced to just a few minutes each morning reviewing Rubrik’s dashboard and email notifications. Further, there have been no backup failures since the implementation.\n“Backups are now completely automated — my team doesn’t have to worry about them anymore and can now work on projects that bring more value to the organisation,” says Henderson.\n“For example, when COVID-19 struck, we had to quickly ramp up our work-from-home capacity to manage a tripling of our remote workforce. Because we weren’t losing time managing backups, we had more capacity to rapidly scale and refine our remote work capability.”\nWith data protection and backups now automated, Henderson says the improvements in data integrity had also helped him and his team nurture a culture of data-driven decision making throughout the organisation.\n“Across the council, proactive use of data to drive decisions has become the first port of call,” he says.\n“Rubrik ensures that wherever our data is, in whatever form it is, it is at our fingertips when we need it. It’s created excitement in the business, and it all comes back to data integrity.”\nAliva CEO David Hawley says its partnership with the Council and Rubrik is rewarding.\n“It is a privilege working with Redland City Council to help manage their security and data management and be partnered with Rubrik in this market.\n“Aliva is a trusted partner for Redland City Council, having helped them reduce the amount of time it takes for them to do backups and recovery from days to a matter of minutes.”\nRubrik managing director for A/NZ Jamie Humphrey says: “At every level of government, data is the lifeblood that ensures the best decisions are made.\n“At the local council level, it’s extremely important as the services provided are those that touch our lives every day. Whether it’s supporting local businesses, connecting community groups, or ensuring environmental sustainability – particularly in an LGA as picturesque as Redland Bay – data insights help councils deliver the services their community needs, when they need them.” Related stories:",

            "text": "GigaIO announces PCIe 4.0 managed accelerator pooling appliance GigaIO Networks has announced its Hydra product line , a fully managed PCI Express (PCIe) Gen 4.0 Pooling Appliance, a high-performance expansion chassis for the disaggregating and pooling of PCIe accelerator devices. This allows data centre operators to pool GPUs and FPGAs, and compose them at native PCIe latency for the increased data centre agility, performance and cost savings. Using the off-the-shelf Ready-To-Run composition software of their choice, data centre managers can transform previously static resource silos into elastic, shareable resource pools, and liberate expensive stranded resources such as accelerators from the legacy servers. The resulting software-defined infrastructure delivers cloud-like flexibility and agility while also reducing TCO (Total Cost of Ownership) and delivering increased performance to their users. GigaIO’s open standards approach to disaggregation and composability with Redfish APIs and off-the-shelf software delivers freedom from vendor lock-in, and removes a significant barrier to widespread adoption of composable infrastructure. The GigaIO Accelerator Pooling Appliance provides up to 1Tb/sec bandwidth into and out of the box. It delivers advanced provisioning and monitoring of compute accelerators and next-gen NVMe assets, supporting up to 8 double-width PCIe 4.0 x16 accelerator cards and 4 PCIe 4.0 x16 low-profile cards. This flexible expansion platform enables users to add any PCIe 4.0 compliant application accelerators, GPUs (including the new NVIDIA A100 ), FPGAs, DPUs, IPUs, thin-NVMe-servers and speciality AI chips. GigaIO’s advanced Redfish API interface provides management software that enables appliance provisioning as well as discovery, inventory, port configuration, diagnostics, monitoring, fault detection, utilisation auditing, and performance monitoring.

            "text": "Aleph Farms is heading towards the transfer of its commercial product – thin-cut beef steaks – into proprietary platform suitable for mass cultivation. The steaks, grown directly from non-GMO cells of a living cow, boast nutritional, culinary, and sensory attributes of meat in terms of texture, flavour and aroma, claims the company. The company has developed five proprietary modules for its unique mass production platform, set to bring the product to cost parity with conventional meat at scale.\nThe prototype of its commercial product will be first introduced at the Asia-Pacific Agri-Food Innovation Summit on November 20 th in Singapore as part of a virtual cooking demonstration hosted by Aleph Farms’ resident chef and VisVires New Protein VC.\nThe company beefed-up its proof-of-concept released in 2018, increased the size of its slaughter-free product, and adapted it to fit controlled, automated bioprocesses to ensure economic viability in large-scale production.\nThe move marks a major leap in Aleph Farms’ goal of making cultivated meat widely available in the global community. The company is currently transitioning its commercial products to pilot plant (BioFarm T ). The pilot launch is planned for the end of 2022.\n“One of the big challenges of cultivated meat is the ability to produce large quantities efficiently at a cost that can compete with conventional meat industry pricing, without compromising on quality,” says Didier Toubia, co-founder and CEO of Aleph Farms. “We have developed five technological building blocks unique to Aleph Farms that are put into a large-scale production process, all patented by the company.”\nMeat cultivation: process of design that is inspired by nature Aleph Farms’ platform for cultivating steaks mirrors the natural process of tissue regeneration processes that occur in the animal’s body, but outside of it and under controlled conditions. The process is designed to use a fraction of the resources required for raising an entire animal for meat, and without antibiotics.\nTo successfully grow whole pieces of meat, compared to minced meat product, the company mimics the extra-cellular matrix found in animals with a plant-based matrix that enables the cells to grow and form structured tissues of meat. Its ‘cell-banks’ yield an unlimited source of pluripotent, non-GMO cow cells’ for growing large quantities of meat without the dependency on living animals.\nAleph Farms has designed patented tissue cultivators to facilitate the biological process occurring in vivo , providing the warmth and basic animal-free elements needed to build tissue in nature. This includes water, proteins, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, and minerals.\nThe gastronomical experience of Aleph Farms’ steak The company has perfected the structure of its product so that it embodies the familiar texture, taste, cooking behavior, as well nutritional qualities of conventional slaughter-based steaks.\n“Aleph Farms is establishing a new category of meat, imbued with its own culture and a new world of meaty experiences,” enthuses Amir Ilan, the company’s Resident Chef.\n“It’s not enough to just make a protein that will fill the nutritional gap; we need to capture the fullness of the meat-eating experience,” adds Toubia. As a French native with roots in food culture, and having studied food engineering in Dijon, Toubia brings his appreciation of gastronomic tradition to his unique cultivation technology. “Meat can be cultivated from cells isolated from different animal breeds, have different cuts, and it elicits different emotions. We see Aleph Farms as crafters of experiences.” Toubia concludes. Post navigation",

            "text": "Global demand for citrus alcohol market is set to hover at nearly 5 per cent growth rate, as growing preference for craft beer, and rising alcohol consumption create fertile ground. A recent study by ESOMAR certified market research and consulting firm, Market Research Insights, analysed citrus alcohol growth in over 20 countries, building a holistic and comprehensive analysis of the market.\nIncreasing inclination among consumers towards craft spirits, owing to their unique and subjective taste is another key factor driving sales. Study opines that proliferating number of breweries across the world will drive demand in the long run.\nThe COVID-19 impact on the market will create short-term challenges through 2021-end, with steady recovery expected from 2022.\nFeatures include: Spirit will remain the largest selling category, capturing over 50 per cent market share. Glass bottles will hold nearly half of market value, owing to safety and minimal risk of leakage. Based on sales channel, specialty stores accounted for over one-fourth of market value in 2020 and will remain the most lucrative channel. Asia Pacific will remain the largest regional market for citrus alcohol, backed by the presence of a large young population base with high spending on alcoholic beverages. Europe and North America will collectively account for nearly 50 per cent market share, being the largest producers and consumers of alcohol.\nCOVID-19 Impact The outbreak of COVID-19 has impacted operations in the food and beverage sector, thus creating a downfall in the volume produced in the first and second quarters of 2020. Moreover, supply-side difficulties such as hindered distribution network and closure of sales channels.\nFurthermore, altered consumer priorities during the lockdown and high demand for essential products, while distribution and sales of non-essentials, including alcoholic beverages, have been deprioritized. On the back of these facets, the growth trajectory of the citrus alcohol market will experience fluctuations during the pandemic. Post navigation",

            "text": "Australian organisations will spend a combined $10.4 billion on public cloud in 2021, according to new research from analyst firm Gartner.\nThat’s an increase of 18 percent from total spend in 2020 which the researcher detailed in the latest quarterly update to its forecast for public cloud services.‘The report stated that cloud software as a service is set to lead the growth in public cloud services with more than $5.7 billion in sales predicted for 2021, up from approximately $4.8 billion this year.\nAustralian spending on cloud platform as a service will hit $1.7 billion in 2021, up from $1.3 billion this year. Spending on infrastructure as a service is set to see a more than $250 million increase next year, to around $1.35 billion from 2020’s $1.1 billion spend.\nGartner analyst Sid Nag said the pandemic “validated cloud’s value proposition”.\n“The ability to use on-demand, scalable cloud models to achieve cost efficiency and business continuity is providing the impetus for organisations to rapidly accelerate their digital business transformation plans,” he said.\nWorldwide spend on cloud is set to hit US$304.9 billion, up from US$257.5 billion in 2020, according to Gartner, an increase of 18 percent.\nThe proportion of IT spending shifting to cloud was projected to make up 14.2 percent of total global enterprise IT spend in 2024, up from 9.1 percent in 2020.\nAlthough software as a service is still the largest market segment and forecast to grow to US$117.7 billion in 2021, Gartner said platform as a service offerings were anticipated to grow by a higher margin at 26.6 percent.\nThe increased consumption of PaaS will be driven by the need for remote workers to have access to high performing, content-rich and scalable infrastructure to perform their duties, which largely comes in the form of modernised and cloud-native applications, Gartner said.

            "text": "Not a fan of your telco and looking to switch? While there’s certainly no shortage of choices, there’s yet one more this week, as Gomo arrives.\nThere’s yet another mobile telco in Australia this week, and like TPG & Vodafone’s Felix , it’s an option coming from a larger telco.\nHinted at only weeks ago when Optus bought Amaysim , one of Australia’s big three telcos said it would have a smaller operator coming, with a mobile brand launching with a single plan. Called Gomo — and likely short for “go mobile”, though we’re waiting on confirmation of that — Gomo is Optus’ latest take on a simple mobile provider, offering one plan through its service for folks who don’t necessarily want to pay for a lot, but still want a reasonable amount.\nThink of Gomo as another budget offering from a larger company, without being direct and saying it’s from a larger company.\nMake no mistake, Gomo is an Optus company, but it’s one that won’t sell phones and is very much into the BYO deal when it comes to operating. You’ll bring your mobile phone, and Gomo will sell one plan, in an attempt to make things simple. That plan is a $25 monthly plan, offering unlimited calls and texts to phones across Australia, unlimited international calls to 15 select places including US, UK, New Zealand, France, Singapore, and more, and then 18GB of monthly downloads on your phone.\nGomo is also bringing a data rollover feature, whereby if you don’t go through the full 18GB, your data can roll over to the next month, and so on, with as much as 200GB included for the live of your data roll over. However unlike other telcos, it’s also skipping the unlimited data option so many telcos rely on if your data amount ends, with a data booster at the end offering 5GB for $5.\nTypically $25 monthly, to sweeten the pot, Optus says it will be offering the first 5000 Gomo customers the first month for $1, while also offering a “buy three months, get three free” plan, with three months available free if three are purchased.\n“Gomo is the go-to solution for Australians who just want more affordable, mobile connectivity, plain and easy,” said Matt Williams, Managing Director of Marketing and Revenue at Optus.\n“We know customers prefer digital service options, so we’ve prioritised that in our offering, along with flexibility and simple activation, so value-seekers get everything they want, and nothing they don’t,” he said.\nWe’re checking whether the “everything they want” also means support for the Optus 5G network, something which has been switched on and is growing, though it wouldn’t surprise as if in the early days, it’s not quite like that. For now, it could just be 4G below $30, which for many might be all it needs to be. ",

More than 20 accolades were awarded during this year’s virtual event, to organisations and individuals representing a broad range of industry sectors, including retail, electronics, manufacturing, healthcare, logistics and food and beverage.\nThe finalists and winners (full list below) were recognised for their best practice approach to sustainable packaging design, industry leadership and sustainability education.\nLyondellBasell took home the coveted Sustainable Packaging Excellence Award at the virtual awards ceremony, recognised for a slew of impressive achievements, including its move to deliver 70% of products in reusable bulk packaging formats and diverting 80% of on-site waste from landfill.\nThis year’s ceremony also included a new category, the Our Packaging Future Awards, which highlighted leadership from Members in three areas: improved collection and recycling systems (awarded to TerraCycle Australia and New Zealand), end-market development (awarded to Coca-Cola Amatil), and sustainable packaging education for both industry (awarded to ALDI) and consumers (awarded to Unilever).\nOther award recipients included Kellogg (Outstanding Achievement in Sustainable Packaging Operations), which has redesigned almost all packaging for optimised materials efficiency and weight reduction, with more than 85% now recyclable through kerbside or via the REDcycle program. Also recognised was CHEP Australia (Outstanding Achievement in Sustainable Packaging Outcomes), which has achieved its outstanding zero product-waste-to-landfill target, and Coca-Cola Amatil (Outstanding Achievement in Leadership), which has achieved the impressive feat of manufacturing 7 out of 10 of its plastic bottles from 100% recycled materials.\nCongratulations also go to Matthew Mills, National Sales and Marketing Manager, Garden City Plastics, who was awarded this year’s Sustainability Champion Award in recognition of his commitment to improving recycling rates for plant packaging and sustainability in the horticulture industry. Advertisement\nThis year’s New Member Award went to KeepCup, an organisation that embraces circularity, reuse and packaging reduction at its core. KeepCup was commended for its commitment to consumer education and engagement, with the brand estimating its ‘reuse revolution’ helps to avoid more than 5 million single-use cups being used every day.\nAssistant Minister for Waste Reduction and Environmental Management, Trevor Evans MP, shared his well wishes with this year’s finalists via a video played during the Awards ceremony. “While 2020 has contained many challenges and distractions, over the last 12 months Australia has continued to make huge progress when it comes to recycling, waste reduction and resource recovery. These Awards showcase some fantastic stories of achievement, innovation and leadership in sustainable packaging, and I applaud all the winners and finalists for their commitment and determination to make 2020 a year of unparalleled delivery towards the 2025 National Packaging Targets”.\nBrooke Donnelly, CEO, APCO commented: “On behalf of the APCO team, congratulations to all of our APCO Awards finalists and winners for 2020. The devastating impacts of COVID-19 have meant a year of deep uncertainty for our industry. Yet despite its numerous challenges, I’m proud to confirm that APCO and our Members have continued to deliver tangible, measurable and inspiring action against the 2025 National Packaging Targets. Every business shortlisted has displayed a dedication to innovative packaging design, a deep commitment to supply chain collaboration and demonstrated clear leadership among their peers and competitors”.\nMitchell Killeen, Managing Director, LyondellBasell Australia (winner of the Sustainable Packaging Excellence Award and the Packaging Manufacturers and Suppliers Industry Sector award) commented: “At LyondellBasell Australia we strive for excellence in everything we do, including safely and reliably delivering high quality products to our customers. In 2019, we are very proud to have delivered more than 70% of our domestic product in reusable packaging, highlighting our commitment to sustainability. It is both a great honour and motivator to receive recognition with this APCO Award.”\nLachlan Feggans, Director, Sustainability, Asia-Pacific, CHEP Australia (winner of the Logistics and Warehousing Industry Sector award and the Outstanding Achievement in Sustainable Packaging Outcomes award) commented: “CHEP is honoured to be recognised at the APCO Awards. Through our share and reuse model, we are committed to making a difference and delivering sustainable supply chains solutions, that meet a growing need. I would like to thank APCO for the leadership role that they play in supporting this growth and also our customers, who are as passionate as ourselves about the value of circularity. We are proud of our zero product-waste-to-landfill achievements and look forward to continuing to support Australian businesses in the achievement of their sustainability goals.”\n?APCO is a not-for-profit organisation leading the development of a circular economy for packaging in Australia.

            "text": "On behalf of the Australian Government, the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) will provide $2.9 million toward a project that will test the impact of electric vehicle (EV) charging on the electricity grid.\nThe funding has been awarded to AGL Energy Services (AGL) to undertake a large-scale EV charging trial across New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria and South Australia.\nAGL is contributing $5.3 million towards the trial, which also involves project partners JET Charge, Chargefox and FlexCharging and a cohort of distribution networks.\nAs part of the $8.25 million trial, AGL will recruit 300 EV owners to demonstrate a range of smart and managed charging solutions with a view to accelerate the commercialisation of different charging technologies by better understanding how consumers use them at home.\nThe project will see AGL install 200 smart chargers at EV owners’ homes where they will be remotely monitored and controlled to help move charging to off-peak times when cheap renewable energy is available or to respond to constraints on the grid.\nAGL will also conduct a software based smart charging trial involving 50 EVs to test the ability of EV charging to be controlled by communicating directly with the car without the need for separate smart charging hardware. Advertisement\nA further 50 EVs will participate in a vehicle to grid (V2G) trial to assess the ability and commerciality of EVs to become a source of energy storage and provide energy back to the grid when required.\nARENA CEO Darren Miller said these trials would allow EVs ‘to benefit the wider electricity system’, and would support the integration of EVs into the system as uptake increased.\n“As more Australians switch to EVs, it will be important to manage and orchestrate EV charging to avoid potentially costly impacts on peak demand, associated network charges and grid security issues,” Mr Miller said .\n“EVs also provide economic opportunities for consumers through the potential of reduced electricity costs through higher network utilisation and the potential to generate revenues that would reduce the cost of car ownership.\n“We hope trials like this will provide valuable insights into how EVs can provide value for money for consumers, but also help to transition our electricity network going forward.”\nAGL General Manager Decentralised Energy Resources Dominique Van Den Berg the trial would enable Australians for the first time to use their EVs to power their houses and export excess energy to the grid.\n“This trial will demonstrate how we create value using customers’ distributed energy assets like batteries and share the value with them,” she said.\n“We’ll be talking to customers during the trial to understand how they feel about smart charging so we can improve their experience.\n“Although the trial is limited to 300 customers, it will help us to shape future energy offers to EV owners.”\nMinister for Energy and Emissions Reduction Angus Taylor added : “By trialling new charging technologies within the home, we will better understand the impact EVs could have on our networks and how to save consumers money as they charge.\n“The Government is backing a range of technologies, not picking one winner. This follows our ‘technology not taxes’ approach to reducing emissions.” Image credit: www.agl.com.au",

            "text": "Image Supplied Article by Louise Bayliss - Setec\nAs a CEO in a manufacturing business that spans more than fifty years, I know the balancing act that goes into guiding and leading a company. A successful enterprise always stands ready to redesign systems and operations in accordance with the current environment, and Setec is no exception. Our history proves a deft ability to remain competitive and strong.\nIn the time now known as pre-COVID, it’s reasonable to say that most industries were cognisant of potential risks and how to mitigate against them. The risk of a natural disaster and its impact to business was well understood. Mitigating the risk of a misplaced shipment was equally recognised. Such potential risks were written into a business plan, ready for action in the event of such risks unfolding.\nIt is, however, a fairly safe assumption that no business plan included a risk mitigation strategy arising from a once-in-100-year pandemic. No one saw this coming.\nAnd when we did see the virus creep across the seas in the early days, many believed it to be an isolated incident. Customers called for stock in substantial quantities, stockpiling materials to get through what was considered a small blip to trading. It was hard to gauge the full impact.\nThere is no doubt that COVID has left businesses scrambling. It’s increasingly difficult for CEOs and business owners to brainstorm the next risk point. There is a constant element of second-guessing, an ever-present need to be vigilant and agile against the next wave of coronavirus; its insidious threat vastly affects the supply chain across the globe, largely due to individual countries and their respective governments reacting with varied tactics. At a business level this takes decision-making out of our hands, held instead at the whim of governments, often with little transparency exhibited to industry and communities alike. And the ripple effect caused by these government edicts brings significant pressure to business owners as we struggle with a vagueness to supply chains. Routes that were previously known and reliable are now unknown and unreliable. Materials that might previously arrive within three or five business days can now take two weeks, sometimes three, as carriers are forced to alter routes to cross borders and enter countries in severe lockdown.\nThe challenge this presents to CEOs lies in a persistence to attempt to keep one step ahead; a resistance to accept the status quo. This might take the form of asking the ‘What ifs’ regarding supply chain routes and ensuring the leadership teams ask them, too. It might be as simple as safeguarding multiple sources for your own suppliers or recognising alterations to the movement of your goods. Advertisement\nAdditionally, CEOs are placed under pressure just to keep the shingle above the door. We are left with little choice but to make more conservative decisions regarding investments, raw materials, and supply chains, all with a reduced revenue. Strategic planning and forward-thinking initiatives, seeking growth opportunities, have been paused to focus on something that is wholly unpredictable.\nIt’s like we’re putting out fires with gasoline.\nHowever, even during this insecurity Setec is proud to be able to serve our customers. Throughout the pandemic, we have navigated blindly, in uncharted circumstances. We’ve split shipments to customers: one section by plane, one by truck, determined to get across the border and into our customers’ warehouses. We are privileged to maintain long-standing relationships with multiple suppliers of particular raw materials, leaving us the option of being able to use different sources as needed. We have invested heavily in building stock so we are equipped and ready to supply our customers consistently and at their need.\nThere will always be gaps, particularly in the current climate, where plans slip and fall. But agility in leadership demands a necessity to rebalance the business. At Setec, we focus on building rapport with our suppliers, customers and people. I believe it is through the channel of connections that we’ve weathered the most unpredictable and volatile risk in our time.\nImage Supplied",

            "text": "Key factors leading to the growth of network security market revenue in the Asia Pacific region includes instances of ransomware attacks, targeted attacks and phishing,\" says Rohit Sharma, senior technology analyst at GlobalData.\nAccording to the analysis, in 2019, China and Japan together accounted for more than three-fifths of network security revenue in the region. China accounts for more than one-third of the overall network revenue. This is due to increasing emphasis by the government for better and more robust network security, GlobalData says. China introduced new cybersecurity law, forcing the companies to adopt network security solutions.\nThe development of new technologies such as artificial intelligence, industrial Internet, and 5G technology has also led to the growth in the requirement of network security solutions, the forecast says. Similar laws have also been introduced in other countries such as Singapore (Cybersecurity Bill) and Malaysia (Anti-Fake News Law).\n\"The COVID-19 pandemic has enforced most of the employees globally to work from remote locations to ensure business continuity,\" says Sharma.\n\"This has resulted in increased instances of data breach threats owing to the lack of resilient network security features at the employees and small and medium enterprises who writhed with time to secure their enterprise networks,\" he says.\n\"With increased emphasis on data security, network security is expected to witness demand by the enterprises over the next few years as well.\" Related stories:",

            "text": "Signs five-year software deal.\nSydney Water is using cloud-based project management software to keep track of the delivery of $4 billion of infrastructure by three consortiums.\nThe water utility has signed a five-year deal with software provider InEight to provide a platform for all parties involved in the capital works to collaborate.\nSydney Water will make a $4 billion investment in infrastructure over the next decade, and will deliver the work via three regional delivery consortiums (RDCs).\nThe RDCs are responsible for end-to-end design, construction, maintenance and facilities management services for water and wastewater infrastructure across Sydney, the Blue Mountains and the Illawarra.\nThey comprise 12 of Australia’s largest engineering and construction firms, including the likes of John Holland, Jacobs and Lendlease.\nSydney Water's head of program delivery Mark Simister told iTnews that the new approach to project delivery, called Partnering for Success (P4S), required IT infrastructure that could support a “radical change in project delivery.”\nRather than allowing each contractor to keep track of project delivery using its own business systems and environment, the new software will enable all partners to work in a single environment.\nThis extra transparency and collaboration will allow Sydney Water to manage costs, reduce risk and “drive predictable outcomes\" on what is a long-term package of works.\n“Everybody's on the same platform, everybody's going to be building things with the same work breakdown structure, and everyone's able to see their project costs in the same format,” Simister said.\nSydney Water has defined the scope of works and responsibilities in its contracts according to the NEC engineering and construction contract specification , NEC4.\nInEight's executive vice president for Asia Pacific Rob Bryant said providing transparency across major infrastructure projects with many collaborators was a challenge.\n“They’re all collecting information and putting in their different perspective of data, so putting that in one place is actually very challenging when you’ve got thousands of people working on a single project over 10 years of the program,” Bryant said.\nInEight's software will allow Sydney Water to keep a closer eye on budgets and schedules.\n“On these mega projects, a lot of the time the projects that fall behind and go over budget are due to unrealistic timeframes around the scheduling or the planning,” Bryant said.\n“Sydney Water is able to utilise the scheduling solution to actually have collaboration in that phase as well.”\nSimister said that project management software isn’t common in the government sector, which instead used financial tools such as spreadsheets, PeopleSoft or SAP “to get a clear line of sight for any project.” ",

            "text": "Puts Azure to work on telematics data.\nTransport for NSW has built a proof-of-concept using machine learning technology from Microsoft to identify potentially dangerous traffic intersections and fast-track remediation works.\nThe ‘dangerous intersections’ proof-of-concept, which took place last year, analysed telematic data collected from 50 vehicles travelling on Wollongong’s roads over a 10-month period.\nThe data – sent from the vehicles at a rate of 25 records a second – was used to pinpoint five previously unknown blackspots, with the two highest-risk now slated for upgrades later this financial year.\nTfNSW’s data discovery program lead Julianna Bodzan came up with the idea while driving down the Mount Ousley descent on the Princes Highway – a notorious, four-and-a-half kilometre stretch of road leading into North Wollongong.\nShe said the telematics data collected from the vehicles was compared with crash data from known blackspots to discern whether or not other intersections in the coastal city were potentially risky.\n“We looked at intersections known as dangerous intersections – dangerous meaning, some kind of fatal or serious crash, or other incident [had] happened,” Bodzan said.\n“Then we started to examine how masses of people are behaving around those intersections.\n“If there are exactly the same patterns at another intersection where nothing has happened yet, we can say that it might happen here as well because people are acting erratically.”\nBodzan noted that erratic behaviour referred to any “harsh braking or harsh acceleration, or any lateral movement just before the intersection”.\nA “circle of interest” was then used to understand a vehicle’s behaviour as it passed through the intersection, as well as 50 metres and 25 metres before and after it.\nBodzan said that a combination of native Azure machine learning services and Databricks was used to “ingest the data and take everything into the cloud”.\nBut as TfNSW business intelligence specialist Oliver Storey explained, the “major challenge was data engineering”, as data from telemetry systems amounted to more than a billion rows.\n“If you give a machine earning algorithm terrible data, you’re going to get terrible results,” he said.\n“So, I’d say, 70 percent of our time was actually spent engineering our data, getting it to a position where we had that one single trip through an intersection which had all of our metrics for the actual vehicle.”\nFollowing the PoC, Bodzan and her team handed over the top five intersections not previously classified as dangerous to the Centre for Road Safety, which sent out road engineers to make an assessment.\n“They actually came back with the validation of, ‘You might be right on that.’ Obviously we can’t say it’s going to happen – but the whole point of this study is to look at which could be dangerous, preventing something happening,” she said.\nTfNSW is now looking at how it might include data from other modes of transport to further improve safety across the transport system, though there are currently limitations on the types of data that can be used.\nThe NSW government is currently working through issues of privacy, transparency and security around artificial intelligence following the release of the state’s inaugural AI strategy in September .\n“Transport is not just roads. We look at railway lines, we are thinking about pedestrians and school zones – and we are thinking about how we can use this type of data and enrichment with other [modes] to basically improve the safety of the network,” Bodzan said.\nStorey added that “vehicle near misses” or “hot areas around the city where people are nearly hit by vehicles” are prime future candidates.\nTfNSW is also using machine learning technology to predict delays across the public transport network and, more recently, to automatically detect suspicious and violent incidents on CCTV footage from Sydney's trains .\nMicrosoft Australia’s chief technology officer Lee Hickin said the work underway at TfNSW had the potential to make the state’s roads safer.\n“Hundreds of lives are lost on NSW roads each year and thousands are seriously injured – using data and AI to identify potential blackspots allows early intervention,” he said.\nHe added that the development of internal expertise at TfNSW, combined with Microsof’s solutions, would deliver a capability “essential to a successful digital transformation and lasting impact”.

            "text": "Network-N Win a free copy of dungeon-crawling shop-management game, Moonlighter! We love a good dungeon-crawler, hacking and slashing our way through room after room packed with horrifying monsters. But it’s nice to have a break, too, and sit back with something a little more homely. We’re talking games like Animal Crossing or Stardew Valley that have a warm, comforting simplicity. Well, what if we told you there’s a game that has the best of both worlds? And what if we told you we were running a giveaway for that game this week…\nMoonlighter is a dungeon-crawler/shop-keeping game where you play as Will, a merchant-turned-hero trying to keep his grandfather’s shop alive. In the game, you delve the dungeon, killing monsters and bosses, and then sell the loot you find in your shop, using the money to revitalise your hometown of Rynoka. It’s a really fantastic formula – read our Moonlighter review for more details!\nThe game originally launched on PC to much critical acclaim, and is coming to iOS on November 19. Lucky for you, we’ve got some copies for this week’s giveaway, so sign up down below if this sounds like you.\nIn order to enter, simply fill out the box below, though please have a look at our terms and conditions first. ios\nMoonlighter iOS giveaway\nIf you can’t wait to play Moonlighter for yourself, you can purchase the game on the App Store from tomorrow. We’ll send the codes out to the lucky winners next Thursday, so keep an eye on your inbox!

I am forced to say to these smaller clients either pay us an implementation fee (which with commission brings the total payment to us to $5,000 in the first year) or go online and sort out your own insurances. This infuriates me and leads to far worse outcomes for clients than if i was able to refer to a trusted 3rd party adviser. \\n \\nBut it is quite obvious that ASIC are actually campaingning for worse consumer outcomes as pretty much all their changes have lead to less access to advice and pushed consumers to the direct sales market where all people are assumed to financially literate and able to make educated decisions and spend a few weeks searching for reasonable alternatives themselves and weighing up the long term consequences of their decisions",

            "text": "Network-N Pokémon Go Beyond increases level cap to 50, introduces Seasons and Kalos Pokémon Pokémon Go Beyond is the next expansion of Pokémon Go – and it’s bigger than anything that has come before. This update includes changes that rival the introduction of Raid Battles and Go Battle League to the game, and trainers of all levels will have something exciting to enjoy. We’ll be going into detail about all of the changes in their own guides, but this is the place you need to be for a quick catch-up on everything..\nFirst of all, the way you level up is changing. Tasks like catching Pokémon, getting new Pokédex entries, and hatching eggs will grant more experience, and from Level 40 onwards you’ll have to complete research tasks as well as earning experience to level up. That’s right – the level cap has increased from 40 to 50. Trainers who reach Level 40 before the end of 2020, however, will earn a special badge and exclusive rewards for being “legacy trainers”.\nNiantic has also promised updates for encountering and catching Pokémon, Adventure Sync, Buddy Adventure, Field Research, Gifts, and more, which we’ll find out about at the start of December.\nSeasons are also coming to Pokémon Go – so Pokémon you encounter will be related to the season you’re currently in. Seasons kick off on December 1, so if you’re in the northern hemisphere, you’ll be more likely to encounter wintery Pokémon – we’re thinking Ice-types and the like, whereas the opposite will be true if you’re in the southern hemisphere. Different forms of Deerling will also be available depending on the season.\nEvents will be themed around the season they occur in, and different new mega-evolved Pokémon will be appearing in raids each season. What’s more, the Go Battle League will expand from 10 to 24 ranks, the top four of which will have all-new names and corresponding badges.\nThe first season is the Season of Celebration, which includes events and research tasks related to the regions of Kanto, Johto, Hoenn, Sinnoh, Unova, or Kalos. Niantic teases this as a “brand-new global event experience,” but we’ll have to wait and see exactly what’s in store.\nAdditionally, Pokémon originally found in the Kalos region are coming to Pokémon Go. This includes Chespin, Quilladin, Chesnaught, Fennekin, Braixen, Delphox, Froakie, Frogadier, Greninja, Bunnelby, Diggersby, Fletchling, Fletchinder, Talonflame, Litleo, Pyroar, and Klefki. Klefki will be regionally exclusive to players in France. These Pokémon arrive from December 2, along with a mysterious one-star raid egg.\nFinally, to celebrate the announcement of Pokémon Go Beyond, Niantic has introduced a 12 Days of Friendship event, which begins at 1:00pm today, November 18 (GMT -8) and lasts until the same time on November 30. Friendship levels will increase faster than normal through the usual means, you’ll get an attack boost when raiding with friends – including remotely – you can open more gifts each day, and you’ll earn increased XP from completing raids. What’s more, there is double XP when catching Pokémon until December 31.\nStay tuned for all the details and in-depth guides covering all of the Pokémon Go Beyond changes in the coming days, and check our Pokémon Go event guide for what’s happening now.

            "text": "Network-N League of Legends: Wild Rift is coming to Europe on December 10 Riot Games has announced that the first regional open beta for its highly-anticipated MOBA, League of Legends: Wild Rift , is coming to Europe on December 10. The open beta also launches in the Middle East & North Africa, Russia & CIS, and Turkey, as well as Oceania, Taiwan, and Vietnam on December 7. This is welcome news after the regional open beta, which launched on October 27, was only available in Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, and Thailand.\nThere’s no change in regards to other regions, however, and Riot still aims to bring Wild Rift to the Americas for 2021, which should coincide with the global release of the game.\nThe Oceania launch on December 7 also coincides with a new patch for Wild Rift, which introduces a number of new champions, skins, bug fixes, and adjustments, rolling out for players worldwide. We don’t have the patch notes yet, but we’ll have more news closer to the time. You can find a full list of current characters in our League of Legends: Wild Rift champions list.\nYou can see the full list of locations in the video below:\nFor those that don’t know, League of Legends: Wild Rift isn’t just a port of the popular of PC MOBA, but is actually built from the ground up, with a new map – the Wild Rift – and a focus on adapting the game to fit mobile play, while also retaining the distinctive spirit of the original League.\nFor more info and news on League of Legends: Wild Rift, check out the official website and Twitter account.

            "text": "CSIRO Head Office Thursday, 19 November, 2020\nCSIRO has signed an agreement with US-based GTI to join a Joint Industry Program on the development of a supercritical CO 2 (sCO 2 ) power plant that could assist mining companies to reach large renewable energy targets.\nWhen used with low-emission energy inputs, advanced sCO 2 power plants have the potential to be a transformational technology that can accelerate the world’s transition to a low-carbon future.\n“While most power plants use steam to produce electricity, sCO 2 power plants use recirculating high-temperature CO 2 instead,” said CSIRO Research Director Energy Technologies, Dr David Harris. “The advantage is that sCO 2 is a higher density working fluid, which means sCO 2 power plants can be smaller, more efficient and not reliant on water for steam.”\nSupercritical CO 2 cycles can also operate using a wide range of heat sources.\n“Their widespread implementation could be a game changer for power generation applications in Australia,” Harris said.\nSupercritical CO 2 turbines offer an autonomous, high-efficiency power cycle that doesn’t rely on steam. This makes such turbines an ideal candidate for power generation in off-grid mining and remote operations, as it allows them to use renewable energy more efficiently to power their operations for longer periods of time.\n“With many mining companies committing to large renewable energy targets, the use of sCO 2 power could be the transformational technology that they are looking for,” Harris added.\nCSIRO’s involvement in the partnership will improve understanding of how sCO 2 power plants can enable lower- and zero-emission technology solutions, and how those plants might be used in remote mining and community locations as a low-cost alternative to diesel fuel power generation.\nOf particular interest is how concentrated solar thermal (CST) technologies could be used to provide renewable energy for these sCO 2 power plants.\nCST technologies capture and store heat, which makes it an ideal solution. The Australian Solar Thermal Research Institute (ASTRI) which is a consortium of CSIRO and six Australian universities, is leading efforts in this area.\n“The use of Thermal Energy Storage (TES) to provide the heat to run these turbines is a critical enabler for renewable energy solutions,” said the Chief Technical Officer of ASTRI, Wes Stein.\nCSIRO is working with Graphite Energy, a highly innovative Australian TES company, on the use of portable and scalable TES units that can be used to store heat to run an sCO 2 power plant.\n“The use of sCO 2 power blocks with our TES units will allow us to deliver the lowest-cost renewable energy solution currently available in the Australian market,” said Graphite Energy CEO Peter Lemmich.\nThe STEP Project demonstration plant has been built in San Antonio Texas at SouthWest Research Institute (SwRI), and equipment installation is underway. It is expected to be operational in mid-2021.\nImage: Low-temperature recuperator and main process cooler are delivered. Source: STEP Project - GTI Energy Related News",

            "text": "Konica Minolta partners with Edith Cowan University on AM Thursday, 19 November, 2020\nKonica Minolta Australia has partnered with Edith Cowan University (ECU) to boost the university’s capability of meeting the growing need for advanced manufacturing facilities in Western Australia.\nECU took delivery of three Konica Minolta advanced 3D printers worth more than $400,000 earlier this year as the first step to developing an advanced additive manufacturing hub for local industry. This included the ProJet 660Pro, the Mark Two desktop composite printer and the Markforged Metal X, which can produce fully functional complex metal parts from design to production within 72 hours.\nThe Markforged Metal X has the unique capability of being able to build honeycomb structures to make parts lighter and has the potential to produce commercial-grade parts, helping industry to explore applications of mass customisation.\n“Partnering with Konica Minolta is a positive move for ECU because of its global connections and strong support for the development of local additive manufacturing capabilities,” said Professor Daryoush Habibi, Executive Dean of the School of Engineering. “ECU would like to see local companies, particularly in the mining and health sectors, be supported by a thriving manufacturing industry in WA and nationally. This year has particularly reinforced the need for local manufacturing capabilities and ECU is exploring the innovative applications for 3D printing to transform this industry.”\nECU VC Research Fellow Dr Ana Vafadar is using the Markforged Metal X for the design and manufacture of innovative heat exchangers.\n“This advanced manufacturing method has significant potential to facilitate the development of high-efficiency heat exchangers due to the complex, geometric freedom this manufacturing technique offers,” she said.\nMatthew Hunter, Innovation Product Marketing Manager at Konica Minolta, said, “COVID-19 has highlighted the need for manufacturing processes to be brought back onshore and 3D printing has a significant role to play in boosting local manufacturing and supply.\n“Helping ECU build its hub by providing 3D printing equipment, as well as collaborating on training and engagement days, will assist Konica Minolta in demonstrating the value that additive manufacturing has in the local market. There is no one-size-fits-all approach to 3D printing, and some equipment and material is better for some applications than others, so creating a hub equipped with multiple machines ensures the best experience.\n“The hub will help the industry in multiple ways with students gaining access to real-world experience and applications, which will ultimately further advance the industry when these students enter the workforce. In addition, manufacturers in WA will be able to access the equipment, as well as the engineering expertise inside ECU, to test their proofs of concept before committing to investing in 3D printing equipment of their own. Ultimately, this partnership with ECU will help drive the adoption of 3D technology in the local market.”\nImage: Dr Ana Vafadar, School of Engineering, ECU. Related News",

            "text": "Making US$1 million or less each year. Apple plans to start a program to lower its App Store commissions for software developers who make US$1 million (A$1.37 million) or less in proceeds each year from the store. Apple takes a 30 percent cut of most purchases made on the App Store, although the commission drops to 15 percent for subscriptions that remain active for more than a year. Apple said developers will automatically get the lower 15 percent rate if they generate US$1 million or less in proceeds - defined as the portion of App Store purchases that the developer keeps - in a calendar year. Apple's App Store fees and rules have come under fire from both large software firms such as Microsoft, Spotify and Match Group as well as numerous startups and smaller companies that allege the fees deprive consumers of choices and push up the price of apps. Apple has responded by saying its rules apply evenly to developers and that the App Store provides an easy way to reach its huge base of users without having to set up payment systems in the 175 countries where it operates. Apple said the new program will start on January 1, 2021. Software developers who netted less than US$1 million from the App Store this year will qualify for the 15 percent rate next year. If the developer's proceeds rise above the US$1 million threshold the next year, Apple's standard rates kick in for the rest of that year. If the developer's proceeds fall below US$1 million in a given year, they become eligible for the lower rate the next year. \"Small businesses are the backbone of our global economy and the beating heart of innovation and opportunity in communities around the world,\" Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a statement. Apple said it will give more details on which developers qualify next month.",

            "text": "Restricts free competition and trade. Ericsson's CEO said Sweden's decision to ban China's Huawei from its 5G telecoms networks restricts free competition and trade, the Financial Times reported. earlier this month halted Huawei from 5G networks over national security risks. The Swedish telecoms gear maker's CEO Borje Ekholm said it was important to have open markets and free competition. \"I belong in that category that believes competition makes us longer term a better company. It may be painful shorter term but longer term it drives us to be more innovative and make better products for our customers,\" he told the FT. Ericsson has won contracts from all three major operators in China to supply radio equipment for 5G networks, while Nokia has not won any 5G radio contracts in the highly competitive market. Huawei, which has denied being a national security risk, has appealed against Sweden's decision to exclude it from 5G networks. China's foreign ministry has said Sweden should address its incorrect decision to ban Huawei and ZTE to avoid a negative impact on Swedish companies in China. Ekholm told FT that he expected the overall rollout of the new telecoms networks to be delayed, adding the political focus in Europe should be on rolling out 5G as fast as possible. \"Think about 4G — the debate in Europe was: what is the killer app? The Americans and Chinese rolled out 4G fastest and the app economy for consumers is now dominated by American and Chinese firms,\" he said. \"5G is going to be the same but for enterprise. Slowing the rollout of 5G is a risk for the economy. Europe risks falling behind again.\"",
