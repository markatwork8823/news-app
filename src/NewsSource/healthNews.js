        "The sex industry should consider older adults when they develop new products and help to counter ageist stereotypes about the sexuality of older people while they’re at it, a medical ethicist has argued in the Journal of Medical Ethics.\nThough older people experience physical changes that can interfere with sexual functioning as they grow older, sexual desire remains, writes Dr Nancy Jecker of the University of Washington.\nWe should be supporting older people to maintain sexual activity that is appropriate to their needs and abilities, and sex robots could be one way to achieve that goal, she writes. Helping older people to engage in sex is a form of self expression, and helps them to maintain a sense of their identity.\nBut agesit views means the sexual needs of older people are often not considered by medical practitioners or when people develop sex toys and aids, and that should change. Sexual desire remains, despite physical obstacles\nOlder adults undergo physical changes that affect their sexual enjoyment, Dr Jecker explained.\n“For older women, this includes shortening and narrowing of the vagina, thinning of the vaginal walls, and reduced lubrication.\n“For older men, it includes taking longer to have an erection, not having an erection as firm or long as in the past, or longer duration between erections.”\nOlder people are also more likely to experience health conditions, such as arthritis, chronic pain, dementia, heart disease and incontinence, that can interfere with sexual functioning.\nYet despite the difficulties, older people maintain sexual feelings and desires, and they adapt over the course of their lives to suit their circumstances and capabilities, Dr Jecker writes.\nResearch shows that older people remain sexually active. In a 2007 study of older home-dwelling people in the United States, researchers found that more than half (53%) of 65-74 year olds were sexually active, as were more than a quarter (26%) of 75-85 year olds. Society ridicules the sexuality of older people\nBut more than health and physical limitations stand in the way of sexuality in our later years. The sexuality of older people is ridiculed and stigmatised by society, Dr Jecker writes.\n“We are still a very ageist society,” Rhonda Nay, Emeritus Professor, Office Nursing & Midwifery, La Trobe University, told HelloCare.\n“People can’t think about their parents haveing sex without gagging,” said Dr Nay, who is an expert in caring for older people and older people’s sexuality.\n“We associate sexuality with youth and stereotypical beauty: firm skin, muscles, young boobs, six packs,” Dr Nay says.\nDr Jecker says, “People in many societies cherish youthful beauty and react with distaste to the bodies of older adults, comparing them unfavourably to a former youthful individual.”\nOlder people tend to hide their sexuality because they know how it is perceived by society, and this simply reinforces the stereotypes, Dr Nay says. Sex robots could support older people\nDr Jecker believes that sex robots are a “critically important” tool to support the sexuality of older people with disabilities.\n“While often depicted as a product designed for younger, able-bodied people, this paper is a bid for reimagining sex robots as a product to support older adults with disabilities,” she writes.\nJust as the sexuality of older people is often neglected by healthcare professionals, sex robots are not pitched to older people with disabilities, they are targeted at young, able-bodied, male customers.\nBut Dr Jecker says ‘sexbots’ for older people could not only help promote and maintain good physical and psychological health among older people, they could help counter ageist beliefs about older people’s sexuality.\nShe describes sexbots as “life-size machine entities with human-like appearance, movement, and behaviour, designed to interact with people in erotic and romantic ways… with capabilities ranging from simple verbal responses, to physical movements, to more advanced artificial intelligence.”\n“Research demonstrates a positive correlation between general health and sexual partnership, frequency of sexual activity, good quality sex life, and interest in sex among middle-aged and older-aged adults,” Dr Jecker explains.\n“With assistance, older adults can continue to be sexual in ways they value, including sustaining sexually intimate relationships, deriving pleasure from sexual activity, and preserving high-quality sexual lives.”\n“Losing the ability to express sexual feelings through the body deprives older people of an important source of love and meaning…\n“When an older person’s body no longer does what they intend it to do, sex robots could intervene, enabling physical contact according to user specification.\n“Just as service robots are being designed to assist older individuals with functions such as eating, dressing and bathing, they might be designed to assist with social functions, serving as sources of affiliation and sexual partnership.” Design for the male and female markets\nThough Dr Nay expressed concerns about sexbots supporting the objectification of women or paedophilia, she said age shouldn’t be an issue when it comes to the development of sex toys.\nThough not acquainted with sexbots specifically, Dr Nay said she imagines they would come with the same risks of other sex toys. “If not maintained and used correctly they could cause physical damage,” she warned.\n“All technology comes with risks… You can get electrocuted by your hair dryer; any intimate object (or indeed person) can cause infections if proper hygiene is not maintained.”\nHowever, sexbots would not be “as dangerous as some objects people get stuck in the vagina or anus/rectum like candles and crystal glasses,” she said.\nDr Nay also urged caution over the replacement of human connection. “Technology should support, not replace, human connection,” she told HelloCare.\nDr Nay also said she would like to see male sex bots as well as female. “Only female is sexist,” she said.\n(Visited 1 times, 5 visits today) Contributor Caroline Egan - HelloCare Editor\nCaroline Egan has been a writer and editor for more than 20 years, and has worked across several sectors, including banking, finance, economics, real estate, and aged care.

        'Mum diagnosed with COVID-19 while pregnant can\'t remember birth\n"I thought I\'d lost my pregnancy because I couldn\'t see my bump any more. I was really worried and disorientated."\nHer twins Sochika Palmer and Osinachi Pasal were cared for in the neonatal intensive care unit, where they remained for 116 days.\nSochika weighed just 770g at birth, while her brother Osinachi weighed 850g.\nTheir mother remained in her coma for more than two weeks after the caesarean.\nUke\'s husband Matthew told the BBC , "Every passing day I was hoping my wife was not among those who are dead." "We are a team, the idea she might not be there was really difficult to accept." (Twitter)\n"We are a team, the idea she might not be there was really difficult to accept."\nUke, who has two older children, told The Express and Sta r she was "very emotional" when meeting her twins for the first time.\n"I was happy that we were all alive, but obviously concerned about their severe prematurity which has its own risks," she said.\nWhen Uke regained consciousness she was suffering from "ICU delirium", which left her "so confused", she told the BBC.\n"When they showed me the pictures, they were so tiny, they didn\'t look like human beings, I couldn\'t believe they were mine," she said.\nSince being discharged from the hospital after nearly three months in the ICU, Uke said the twins are "getting better" each day.\nFor a daily dose of 9Honey, sign up here to receive our top stories straight to your inbox',

        'Sex, Dating and the Sisterhood: Should you ever take back a cheater? Cazzie David and her dad Larry David in 2013. (Getty)\nAs a result, "being flaked on sucks", David declares, because she\'ll be left hungry and not "even get laid."\n"The only reason [women] will say no to a spontaneous hang is because it\'s after dinner and we don\'t feel hot," she asserts.\n"It will pain us to say no for this reason, but trust me, we will."\nDavid has attracted particular concern for drawing a correlation between heterosexual women having "no control" when rejecting men over the prospect of "being full", and one\'s sexual orientation or religion.\nIn a flurry of social media criticism, her opinions were called out for being "deeply unfunny".\nOne Twitter user claimed the piece read like it was "written like 12 years ago," asking, "Who still talks about men and sex like this?\nDavid\'s piece also didn\'t land well in the midst of trans visibility week, with critics slammed the author for her inability to write about sex in a progressive way.\n"I couldn\'t get past the second paragraph where she says \'both genders\'," one reader tweeted.\n"I actually think sex ed failed Cazzie David and it\'s NOT FUNNY," shared another.\nOthers took swipe at David\'s status as the "privileged" daughter of a celebrity, which she acknowledges in an excerpt of the essay. Cazzie David was previously linked to comedian Pete Davidson. (Instagram)\n"My problem isn\'t that Cazzie David wrote a book. It\'s that the spawn of celebrities always have a head start in entertainment, and as long as they ~acknowledge~ it, we\'re supposed to pretend like it\'s fine because they\'re somewhat talented," tweeted one critic.\n"I have read like six paragraphs of the Cazzie David essay and I cannot read another but man having rich well-connected parents seems like the most incredible drug in the world," said another.\nSome jumped to David\'s defence, one writing, "Going to go ahead and have an opinion about the Cazzie David essay, and the truth is, I liked it."\nAnother took one final, harsh swipe: "Imagine being the editor who picked the Cazzie David excerpt."\nFor a daily dose of 9Honey, sign up here to receive our top stories straight to your inbox',

        "Workplaces have an opportunity to do something. To put a stake in the ground and say – our staff and people matter.\nAs this new normal continues, I sense that building into your workplace culture, mindfulness and a proactive mental wellness charter as part of your company’s values will become a duty of care. Not a nice to have, but a duty of care.\nAnd the rewards are there. Helping your staff switch off their minds means they recharge and refuel; no one can work relentlessly without falling over at some point. Putting into place a wellness charter that supports, educates, and helps your staff is a business safety measurement. It ensures your staff look after their mental wellness, which means they will have better cognitive performance.\nIt creates loyalty from your employees; and it means staff are happier, more engaged, and connected, and you are more likely to retain the right talent.\nSo how do you build mindfulness into your workplace? Here are three tips to get your organisation (whatever the size) started – Start somewhere\nThe first step is to start – you may not have all the answers and strategy nutted out, but start somewhere. Not taking action is going to cost you, be proactive. Ask your staff\nAsk your staff what they want. Each organisation is unique; asking some simple questions, get feedback from your employees on what they would like. Involving your staff, you get buy-in and drive what they want, which means more engagement. Make a Wellness Mission statement\nEvery business is based on its people. Make a statement to your employees that they matter. You might not have all the answers right away, but you are working on it.\nTo quote Jerry Maguire and his famous mission statement – “the key to business is personal relationships.”\nBringing mindfulness and mental wellness programs into organisations sends the message that your people are valued.

        "A\nHow far do people move to access aged care?\nNew research shows many people in non-metropolitan regions move more than 100 kilometres, or drive for more than 60 minutes, from their home when they begin permanent residential aged care or use respite in an aged care facility.\nThe research, which was conducted by the Office of the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety, is based on people accessing aged care services on 30 June 2019. The findings are presented in Research Paper 16 – How far do people move to access aged care? which is available on the Royal Commission’s website.\nIn regional and rural areas the share of people that moved over 100 kilometres to enter permanent residential care varied between 10% and 16%. The share increased to 34% among the people who had been living in remote regions and 53% among those who had been living in very remote regions.\nAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people tended to move further than other people to enter residential aged care if they were living in metropolitan or rural areas, but moved less distance if they were living in remote or very remote regions.\nYounger people living in residential aged care facilities tended to have moved further than older people in all regions except for very remote communities.\nThe research used data that is routinely collected by the Department of Health and could be updated annually to assist with planning to make aged care services more accessible to people in different communities.\nThe research paper was prepared for the information of the Royal Commissioners and the public. Any views expressed in the paper are not necessarily the views of the Commissioners.\nTo read the Royal Commission’s research papers, please visit the publications page.

        "by Peta Carige | 30 seconds ago\nAny meal plan for a ‘health kick’ or simply to fuel your brain and training schedule starts with planning your shopping. For a busy woman this often means scheduling it in but in addition to that I always request my clients to schedule a primary shop and then a secondary ‘top up’ shop to stock up on additional fresh food items that run out first.\nNumber one. Schedule your shopping in weekly.\nCorporate workers are very similar to athletes when it comes to planning their meals for the week, because they too will have multiple nights when they arrive home late or nights that they know they are exhausted, so they need something quick for dinner. Number two: What nights do you need a quick dinner?\nOnce you have figured out the above you can then start to plan your dinners. Often people like to use leftovers for lunch, but I much prefer to use them for a quick dinner. You will never regret walking in the door exhausted at 8pm and remembering you have leftovers to simply heat-up.\nAnother go-to quick dinner is eggs! Have them on toast, or as an omelette; they’re the perfect food to eat at any time.\nSimilarly, we often associate wraps with lunch, but for a quick dinner, throw either some frozen fish fillets or chicken thighs in the oven to bake, jump through the shower then make wraps on mountain bread with whatever salad items you have lying around. I think too often we think dinner needs to be a full meal or from a recipe to be nutritious and it just is not the case. Number three. Have your go-to quick dinner meal options sorted\nMoving on from dinners because in my fifteen years of experience, most people and families planned dinners outside of these time-poor evenings are healthy and also what they are comfortable with, so they rarely change.\nWhere busy people struggle is lunch and snacks. So, when it comes to lunches, do not be scared of the frozen aisle. The odd frozen healthy meal or frozen vegetables that you add tinned tuna or salmon to make for great variety from your workplace café, they are very nutrient dense and quick to prep at work. Number four. Take advantage of healthy frozen options for lunches\nLastly, but possibly the most important is your snack choices. They are essential to tie you over to your meals when meetings run late or more importantly fuel your brain to power through your afternoon of work, your body through its gym class before you walk in the door to your second job.\nWhere people go wrong with their snacks is A) they haven’t purchased enough at the shops to last the week (see point number one) and B) they are scared to eat enough at snack times and convince themselves that one biscuit from the biscuit jar is enough to get them through.\nWomen are scared to snack and I have no idea why? So be organised but be generous with your snack draw. Stock it full of cruskets, nuts, healthy dips, chopped vegetables, fruit (yes fruit is allowed), yoghurt, boiled eggs, homemade slices, homemade protein balls and the odd milky coffee of course. Number five. Do not be afraid to snack until you are satiated!\nI hope these five tips help you prioritise and simplify your meal planning during those big work weeks but most importantly provide some ideas that work with your lifestyle so they can be implemented and maintained.

        'The girls were awarded the People\'s Choice Award for their heart-warming video. (Supplied) "The elderly often go unheard, and it\'s so important to make them feel loved."\nDuring the emotional video, residents open the girls\' packages and read their letters aloud, beaming and tearing up over the kind gesture.\nOne woman exclaims, "That\'s beautiful!" as she finishes reading one of the notes the students sent her.\nKairi says their project quickly became a testament to how "even doing little things," can "change the world slowly." "The elderly often go unheard, and it\'s so important to make them feel loved."

After making their video, the three girls agree it\'s vital to "all stay together and connect more than ever." (Supplied)\nVideos for Change is a national competition, created by educational program High Resolves, encouraging young people to make one-minute videos that raise awareness and inspire action.\nIn response to the pandemic, this year\'s competition challenged students to answer the question: "What does \'community\' mean in a crisis?"\nFounder Roya Baghai says, "These one-minute videos build empathy and touch your heart.

        "by Madeline Hislop | 34 seconds ago\nA landmark report has revealed that Australian special forces soldiers were allegedly involved in the unlawful killings of 39 Afghan civilians and prisoners of war, and the cruel treatment of two others.\nAustralian Defence Force Chief Angus Campbell fronted the media on Thursday to deliver the findings of the review, calling the actions of some defence force troops “deeply disturbing” and labelling their actions as “grave misconduct”.\nThe report , collated over a four-year-period by Maj Gen Justice Paul Brereton, found “credible information” relating to the war crimes of 25 current or former Australian Defence Force personnel. Thirty-six matters have been recommended to be investigated by the federal police, and relate to 23 incidents involving 19 personnel.\nThe report, which is heavily redacted in large parts, highlighted some confronting conduct, including that new recruits were instructed by more senior soldiers to kill prisoners of war, part of a “blooding” process, designed to give them their first kill. The report also said that “possibly the most disgraceful episode of Australia’s military history” was committed in 2012.\nNone of the killings alleged in the report were committed in the heat of the battle. The victims were described as “non-combatants”, and that the 23 incidents, if accepted by a jury, “would be the war crime of murder”.\n“None were alleged to have occurred in circumstances in which the intent of the perpetrator was unclear, confused or mistaken,” General Campbell said on Thursday.\n“And every person spoken to by the inquiry thoroughly understood the law of armed conflict and the rule of engagement under which they operated. These findings allege the most serious breaches of military conduct and professional values.”\nThe report suggests there is a cover-up culture within the Special Air Service.\nJustice Brereton found credible information that some members of the Special Operations Task Group carried ‘throwdowns”– foreign weapons or equipment –“to be placed with the bodies of ‘enemy killed in action’ for the purposes of site exploitation photography, in order to portray that the person killed had been carrying the weapon or other military equipment when engaged and was a legitimate target.”\n“‘Throwdowns’ would be placed with the body, and a ‘cover story’ was created for the purposes of operational reporting and to deflect scrutiny. This was reinforced with a code of silence,” the report says.\nIt is written that this practice evolved “to be used for the purpose of concealing deliberate unlawful killings”.\nGeneral Campbell offered an apology “for any wrongdoing by Australian soldiers”, and said he had already offered an apology to his Afghan counterpart.\n“Such alleged behaviour profoundly disrespected the trust placed in us by the Afghan people who had asked us to their country to help them,” he said.\nJustice Brereton, the author of the report, placed the largest share of blame on patrol commanders.\n“While it would have been much easier to report that it was poor command and leadership that was primarily to blame for the events disclosed in this Report, that would be a gross distortion,” he wrote.\n“While, as will appear, commanders at troop, squadron and Special Operations Task Group level must bear some responsibility for the events that happened ‘on their watch’, the criminal behaviour of a few was commenced, committed, continued and concealed at the patrol commander level, that is, at corporal or sergeant level.”\nThe report provided 143 recommendations, which General Campbell said he accepts and promised swift administrative and disciplinary action.\n“It has to be said that what this report discloses is disgraceful and a profound betrayal of the Australian Defence Force’s professional standards and expectations,” the report says.\n“Ultimately, there is an important difference between pulling a trigger and getting it wrong, and taking a prisoner and executing them in cold blood. Anyone who does not recognise this distinction, or is prepared to ignore it, does not deserve to belong in any professional military, let alone the ADF.” Share this",

        "Beginner-friendly spiritual practices to help you dip your toes into the spirituality realm.\nSo your #spiritual friend told you to download co-star, but you don’t quite understand all of the astrology jargon? Maybe you’ve always been curious about tarot card readers and psychics but have always been too sceptical to actually book a reading.\nAs spiritual practices like these become more and more mainstream, it’s normal for people to want to explore and tap into their more spiritual and intuitive side, but with 100s of different practices out there, it’s hard to know where to start.\nWith this in mind, we’ve collated some of our favourite and most accessible practices that you can try as a gateway to unlock your spirituality, without turning into a full-blown (and public) witch – unless of course, you want to. Crystals\nLet’s start by talking about how crystals actually work.\nEverything on earth vibrates on different frequencies, on a large scale with the sun or on a much smaller scale with molecular movement. Living things and non-living things alike are all vibrating on different frequencies.\nOn a personal level, our entire body system is just energy that shows up in different densities and patterns. Our thoughts and emotions are connected to our physical bodies and have a density of their own. When these patterns and frequencies work in a balanced way then we experience our health.\nHowever, when these energy patterns are disrupted it results in poor health such as headaches, or more serious illnesses. Crystals are thought to be the most stable form of matter in the universe due to how they are formed in the earth’s crust. As a result, crystals act as tuners. They bring us to higher vibrations and can evoke our best selves and allow us to focus on our true purpose. They can also ‘recharge’ us, bringing energetic imbalances back to a stable level. Each crystal itself has a different vibration because they are made of different material. This is why you read about different crystals having different healing properties – because those vibrations align with a certain vibration within you.\nTo effectively use crystals you have to be honest with yourself. Focus on what you really need in life, not what you want. Crystals will not grant you a new boyfriend, but they can help you open your heart and bring love into your life and remove any blockages to love you may have.\nCrystals will not get you a new jacket or make you more popular, but they can lessen insecurities that are the root of those desires.\nEach crystal has different specific healing properties. Usually when you buy a crystal at a shop or a market it will come with a little card that tells you its properties.\nIf there isn’t one available, just ask someone who works there what crystal it is and google it yourself. However here is a little guide to some of the more common crystals to help you get your crystal collection started! Unlock the potential of your crystals\nHow to use crystals:\nPersonally, my favourite way to use crystals is to hold them while I meditate or carry them with me in my pocket. If I am feeling particularly anxious, I will often place the crystal in my bra so it is close to my heart.\nHowever, you can also buy larger crystals to keep around your home. These days, many beauty and skincare products are also infused with crystals !\nOther than finding crystals at markets, these days there are also many great online crystal retailers – like Core Crystal Co and Bliss Me . When purchasing your crystals, it is also important to find a retailer that ethically sources their crystals. As the crystal and wellness industry grows, many crystals are often traced back to mines with lax mining regulations for children and child labour. Oracle Cards\nUnlike Tarot Cards which take time to study and interpret, Oracle cards can range from affirmations, to guidance, to manifestations or visual cues. In this way, you can choose a deck of cards that resonates with you most.\nThis idea of ‘resonating’ and intuition is very important when it comes to oracle cards as this is what they are designed to develop.\nHow to use oracle cards:\nBecause oracle decks are designed to train your intuition, many oracle card readers simply shuffle and choose as many cards as feels right. You could do this once a day, or whenever you feel like you need guidance. Most card decks come with a guidebook of what the card ‘means’, but depdnign on the deck this can be open to interpretation. If your card has an affirmation you are invited to muse on what that affirmation means or brings up for you.\nSome great oracle decks include:",

At the time, the documentary explains, the government decided on these royal matters.\n\"Churchill wanted the new Queen in the palace of her ancestors, who had chosen it as an official residence since the time of Queen Victoria,\" Angela adds. A timeline of Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip's relationship milestones. (9Honey)\nThe Queen and Philip effectively swapped places with the Queen Mother and Princess Margaret, who moved out of Buckingham Palace to Clarence House.\nWhile Buckingham Palace is the Queen's main residence, and was for Prince Philip until he retired from public life in 2017, the couple also frequent their other properties.\nEvery year, the couple spends Easter in Windsor Castle, then heads north during the summer months to relax at Balmoral Castle, their sprawling Scottish estate. The Queen and Prince Philip have spent most of 2020 based at Windsor Castle. (Instagram @theroyalfamily)\nThen, come Christmas time, it's north again to Sandringham House in Norfolk, where they're usually joined by other royal family members for the holiday.\nIn 2020, Windsor Castle became the Queen and Prince Philip's main base, the couple isolating together during the coronavirus pandemic.\nAfter spending summer at Balmoral, the Duke travelled back to Sandringham, where he'd been based since his retirement, while the Queen returned to Windsor Castle. These are the most expensive royal estates, palaces and castles",

        "Tracey Mylecharane, Director, Tracey Mylecharane Solicitor 19/11/2020\nTracey Mylecharane is the Director of Tracey Mylecharane Solicitor , a virtual, online boutique law practice providing legal services to individuals, businesses and corporations Australia wide. With a slew of legal qualifications and experience, Tracey has also lectured in law at ANU and UNSW .\nAn innate collaborator, Tracey Co-Founded Business Minds Collaboration to help SME businesses to find reliable and experienced expert business services. She has also just launched a new podcast, Rise Up in Business , to demystify business legal basics and support small business owners who find navigating the law more than a trifle bamboozling! After being a Founding Partner in a firm for six years, why did you start your own law firm Tracey Mylecharane Solicitor ? This is a classic “we don’t’ know what we don’t know”. For so long I honestly thought that the busyness and intensity of my life and career was what practicing law was just supposed to be like. Then I had my little boy (who is now 6 years old) and within a couple of weeks I realised this wasn’t for me any longer. That if I continued on with that mindset, something was going to give, and I wasn’t prepared to let that be parenting. So I pivoted, left the practice of law, and took my life in a completely different direction. Five years later, and with a daughter as well, I created a way to be able to dive back into the passion I had for practicing law and enriching the lives of my clients – whilst allowing myself some time and space to parent without missing out. The rest, as they say, is history. How do you operate as a trusted advisor to businesses, and why has this become even more important during COVID? Practicing law for me is so much more than acting on a matter for a client, and then saying goodbye. I have developed long standing relationships with almost all of my wonderful clients, and I am so grateful for that. What that ultimately means is that when they have an issue moving forward, or a question – whether it be in relation to a contract they want to enter into, or a question about a contractor they are thinking of taking on, or if they haven’t been paid – they feel comfortable picking up the phone and chatting to me about it, or sending me a quick email. It’s like I have become part of their team, and I am included in decisions moving forward. This has become particularly important during COVID because there has been so much uncertainty for small business owners, and often they had nowhere to turn for support, and for answers. I have been privileged to be able to offer support where I can, and to help address their questions and strategise future direction. This is without doubt, one of the highlights of my job! Why did you start Business Minds Collaboration and how does it help people? At the onset of COVID it became increasingly clear to me that small business owners can’t do it all alone, and they shouldn’t be expected to. I was fortunate to be operating within a business model that was well positioned to deal with the COVID restrictions, and clients were asking me more frequently how they could locate other service providers who operated in a similar fashion. It occurred to me that people simply did not know how to find a good accountant, or a good marketing manager (and the list goes on). That was the starting point for Business Minds Collaboration . Business Minds Collaboration has been designed to bring together a team of experts who are able to work virtually/remotely, to help ease the pressure on small business. My hope is that small business owners can take confidence knowing that the team of minds have been carefully selected to ensure a high standard of competence and professionalism, and they can engage comfortably with them knowing they are in good hands. What are some of the topics you will be covering in the your new podcast, Rise Up In Business ? My intention with Rise Up in Business is to reach more small business owners and help them by distilling and explaining important legal matters, in a really simple way. The topics that I am planning to cover can become very boring very quickly for most people (that is, for non-lawyers!). I aim to prevent the ’eyes glazing over’ with some clever, practical and easy to adopt discussion, tips and tricks. The first season will cover the basics for small business owners, business structures, business legals, the Australian Consumer Law, website documents, and so much more! Your greatest challenge? Bucking the trend and backing myself to create a business model that works for me – and by extension, helps significantly more clients. When I started my business in early 2019, I was met with so much negativity within the profession . It won’t work. It’s not sustainable. It’ll never take off. You name it. But here I am more than 18 months later, with a thriving business, some real balance between work and home life, with time for my family, and with a new podcast launching! I honestly couldn’t be happier that I made the call to back myself and jump in boots and all.\nTracey Mylecharane – Solicitor ",

        'RELATED: Women overwhelmingly represent unemployment figures during COVID Lisa Smith was rejected from a job she drove over 3,000km to secure. (LinkedIn)\nSmith notes she\'d even been "flaked on" three times by a prospective interviewer, or suffered the "eternal ghosting" of job officers never responding to her applications.\nThe woman concludes her post by noting she has "NEVER in all my years of recruiting or in my own job searches seen such horrible, rude, inconsiderate behaviour."\n"PLEASE read the resume first. Value applicants time too. Make time to speak to the candidate & be present," she begs.\nIn a final blow, Smith says, "Quit overlooking the unemployed. Learn what emotional intelligence is. Stop ghosting."\nAccording to the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), Australia\'s unemployment rate peaked at 7.5 per cent in July during the pandemic. The unemployment rate continues to rise, but part-time work has jumped. (9News)\nWhile the numbers have dropped to 6.9 per cent as certain states slowly open up again, Kristin O\'Connell, a spokesperson for the Australian Unemployed Workers\' Union tells 9Honey, such action from employers, "really demoralises people."\n"It really breaks people to have constant rejection," O\'Connell notes, adding, "to be forced to not only apply for jobs when there are no jobs, but also to apply for jobs that they know they\'re not well suited to."\nExplaining there "simply aren\'t enough relevant jobs" in the current market, O\'Connell says the cycle of unemployment has been an issue long before COVID. "Now it\'s far beyond breaking point - we have double the number of people who are unemployed.\nO\'Connell says through her work, she\'s met people who have been forced into "cold calling businesses", or "walking around in their community, talking to places who aren\'t even advertising for employees."\n"People know that they\'re going to be rejected - it is a constant exposure to rejection," O\'Connell shares.\n"And that is just one of the many reasons why this is wasteful and harmful."\nWith over 2,000 comments on her LinkedIn post, Smith amplified the frustration many job seekers are feeling across the world.\n"I can definitely relate. When I was looking for a job in HR, I was blown away at how unprofessional some people were. They showed me how not to treat people," wrote one user.\n"I am on the job hunt as well and have literally had the job offered to me in person then never heard back from anyone at the company. That is just one of the many unacceptable behaviours I have come across. So inconsiderate of these recruiters," shared another.\nSmith added in the comments to her post, explaining she is yet to secure employment, and that "anyone who sees this and has treated a candidate in a rude or unprofessional way learns something from it."',

        'Clarke Gayford and Jacinda Ardern have been together since 2013. (Instagram)\nThe pair began dating in 2013, and four years later their relationship became a lot more high-profile.\nIn August 2017, Ardern became the leader of New Zealand\'s Labour Party, and seven weeks later she was elected to the office of Prime Minister.\nRELATED: Clarke Gayford plays family hairdresser during lockdown\nGayford recalled he was diving in Queensland when his partner became Labour leader, sparking "a swift and sudden turn" in their life together.\n"As I was about to go down underwater I turned my phone off, like \'I don\'t want to know about this\'," he told Nova\'s Fitzy and Wippa. "The guy on the boat said, \'Your missus has had a promotion\'." (Getty)\n"When I came back up the guy on the boat said, \'Yeah, mate, you might want to call back home. Your missus has had a promotion\'."\nPolitics and major world events aside, the last three years have produced some major milestones for Ardern and Gayford.\nIn June 2018, the couple welcomed their first child, daughter Neve Te Aroha Ardern Gayford , making Ardern the second world leader to give birth while in office.\nThe following year, they became engaged during the Easter break, with Clarke proposing on top of the Mokotahi Hill in Mahia. Gayford admits the way he met Ardern was "slightly embarrassing". (AP)\nThe broadcaster and fishing enthusiast admits his days look rather different to his fiancee\'s.\nJust last Saturday, she was tied up with a conference requiring calls through the night.\n"She was doing interviews from 12 midnight through to three in the morning. I got up 2.5 hours later and snuck off working, out spearfishing," he laughed. All the times Jacinda Ardern has made the world love her',

        "Christine Khor, CEO, Peeplcoach 19/11/2020\nChris Khor, CEO and Founder of Peeplcoach is a straight talking dynamo, and serial entrepreneur whose executive recruitment business led her to follow her passion of helping all people to flourish in their careers, and establish Peeplcoach , an on-demand career and leadership development coaching platform.\nWith an enviable list of blue chip corporate clients, Peeplcoach were awarded Silver in HRD Magazine Australia 2020 HR Services Awards for Learning and Development. How does your experience as a Board Director of The Hunger Project Australia shape your perspective of the corporate world? Since my trip to Uganda with The Hunger Project in 2012 I have a very different perspective of what is “good” or “bad” or “risky”, particularly when it comes to making decisions and feeling stress. Whilst I still get annoyed and frustrated about many things I rarely feel “overwhelming stress”. Overwhelming stress, a feeling of hopelessness, of literally being faced with life and death situations and decisions, is what I saw in Uganda and Malawi and many of the countries The Hunger Project partners. In Australia, my business and success may be impacted by circumstances such as COVID or things may not go to plan but these issues will rarely have a long lasting impact or cost a life. Revenue or profitability may drop, but my children will still have a warm bed to sleep in, a healthy meal to eat (whether they want it or not) and I won’t be at risk of being assaulted gathering water or going to the “bathroom” in the night. Business problems can be complex. How to raise capital, increase employee engagement or combat an aggressive competitor but they are not as critical or urgent as the problem of “how do I feed my three children once or twice this week when there has been drought, the crops have all died and there is no job keeper, job seeker or Medicare?!”. When I compare these two types of problems, I find the business ones much easier to deal with and solve! My approach is literally “don’t sweat the small stuff”. How have you built Peeplcoach’s team and culture? Cultures are like a disease – they are created to protect themselves and they are very hard to change or get rid of. When starting Peeplcoach I decided that I wanted to work with people that have the same values as me. We can learn skills but it is nearly impossible to “learn” new values. Cultures and values are tested when we are under pressure – as we all have been during 2020. When you put pressure or squeeze a great culture, greatness comes out. When you put pressure on poor cultures (or poor leaders), poor behaviours come out. I am sure we have all seen both of these over the last few months. Like many businesses, especially HR businesses, we were put under pressure. One of my values – both personally and for Peeplcoach – is generosity of spirit. When COVID hit there were clients who could not continue and many individuals who needed assistance but did not have the resources or budget to allocate to coaching. I offered my services for free coaching and then I asked my coaches who would be willing to volunteer and offer free coaching and consulting sessions. Within 24 hours my team had volunteered over 50 free coaching sessions. This is what I call great culture and great team spirit. We continue to build and nurture our culture by being very particular about the people we bring onto the team. For us technical expertise is the easy part, the hard part is finding individuals with the right values, who fit with us and who will present themselves and Peeplcoach the way we want to be presented. How do you help other women in business? One of the key reasons I started Peeplcoach was because I believe in equal opportunity and equal access to resources for all irrespective of age, race, religion and, of course, gender. As an executive coach I had the opportunity to work with amazing leaders to help them develop their leadership capacity, their business performance and ultimately drive their career. I love what I do and I can make impact, but I realised that the majority of the people I was coaching were white, Anglo-Saxon men. I am proud to say that, as of November 2020, 47.4% of the participants registered on our system are women. Imagine if our boards or executive teams could claim the same statistic? One of the programs we have developed focuses on diversity and inclusion and we approach the question of diversity with a lens of the “gatekeeper” as well as from the point of view of the “diverse” themselves. Here are two examples of how to think about diversity. As a gatekeeper of diversity: Are you equally promoting/referring the “diverse” – in this case women? I find many women get frustrated with “the boys club” and I challenge that. I think that the boys club is great. Men talk to men about their businesses, they refer each other and they work together. Women – why don’t we do this? Too often, women choose not to work with their female friends because they do not want to blur the lines of business and friendship. Stop it! If we want equality and to build our networks we need to start referring and supporting our female friends and colleagues. As someone in the “diverse” category, what are you doing to restrict your opportunities? Do you stop yourself asking for help because you don’t want to appear pushy? Do you wait to be approached because “good girls” wait to be asked and are never too pushy or intense? Do you shy away from “dropping in” someone’s name because you don’t want to seem that you are “using” them. Again, I challenge this. Recently I met with someone in the US to discuss the VC industry and I asked for his advice. He suggested that I apply for an accelerator called Launch.io and to tell them that he sent me. I completed the application and at the end I received the standard response saying “thank you very much for your application but we only respond to <1% of applications so don’t be offended if you do not hear from us”. There was nowhere for me to name drop but there was a contact email. So I replied to this contact email saying “Thanks for the opportunity to apply. Chuck (my huge name drop) told me to apply so I hope I am one of the 1%. All the best.” Within 60 seconds I got a reply and a Calendly invite to book a 17 minute meeting! At the time of writing this I haven’t had the meeting yet, but fingers crossed. At best I will have been accepted, at worst I will have gotten some great insight and another opportunity to get feedback on my business. I had nothing to lose from trying. A 1% chance is still a chance! What are some of the ways you lead by example? Well I don’t really try to lead by example I just try to lead myself. My latest internal mantra is “stop trying to impress others, focus on impressing myself”. I am focused on doing what I think is right, what is going to make me happy, what I am going to be proud talking about, what is going to move me forward in the way I want to be moved and what is going to help me achieve my goals. The only people I need to be proud of me are me, my husband and my children! Everyone else is a bonus. What is the best way for people to try Peeplcoach ?

        "An interim decision to make nicotine for use in e-cigarettes available in Australia, but only with a doctor’s prescription, will help make vaping products harder to access, AMA President Dr Omar Khorshid said today. The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) has proposed amendments to clarify that nicotine products for e-cigarettes can only be imported for use when prescribed by a doctor. “Nicotine is a poison, and the AMA opposes all use of nicotine-containing vaping products,” Dr Khorshid said. “Exposure to nicotine can harm adolescent brain development, and nicotine vaping products contain carcinogens including formaldehyde and solvents. “The evidence that vaping is effective as a quit smoking aid is inconclusive, but there is plenty of evidence that it causes harm. Multiple studies show that vaping can lead to previous non-smokers taking up tobacco smoking, and that people using vaping as a quit aid are significantly more likely to still be vaping after a year than people using nicotine patches or other therapies. “The proposed change will stop people accessing nicotine for any use without a prescription, and will ensure that patients see their doctor for advice on the most reliable and safe smoking cessation methods. “While doctors can already prescribe nicotine for vaping, it is very rare – the TGA estimates that only about 10 doctors in Australia currently do so. “There is currently no TGA-approved nicotine vaping product, due to a lack of evidence of their efficacy or safety, and their use should be only as a method of last resort. “While doctors are overwhelmingly reluctant to prescribe nicotine, the AMA anticipates an influx of patients asking their doctors for nicotine prescriptions for vaping when the changes come into effect, spurred on by a tiny but vocal minority of vaping advocates, backed by Big Tobacco. “Doctors will need clear and well-communicated guidance on appropriate dosages and recommended timeframes for use. The AMA recommends including a time limit for prescribing these products to ensure that patients who do not intend quitting cannot have access to an ongoing supply. “The prescribing criteria must also specify that nicotine-containing products may only be prescribed to current smokers, and we strongly recommend that the changes should be evaluated after 12 months to assess the impact on smoking rates.” The AMA submission to the TGA is available here . Dr Khorshid will give evidence today to the Senate Select Committee Inquiry into Tobacco Harm Reduction, which is examining the treatment of nicotine vaping products in developed countries similar to Australia, and any impacts on smoking rates. The AMA submission to the Inquiry is available here . Background Doctors can already prescribe nicotine for vaping products when used therapeutically, however, they must go through the TGA Access Pathways (Special Access Scheme, or Authorised Prescriber Pathway). Nicotine in vaping products for non-medical use is illegal to sell in all States and Territories, and illegal to possess in all States and Territories except South Australia. However, confusion exists around their importation from overseas because their illegal status is under State and Territory legislation. Changing the Schedule 4 entry for all human use would mean that nicotine for e-cigarettes would only be supplied in accordance with a doctor’s prescription. People with a prescription will be able to access the products under the TGA Personal Implementation Scheme, or through a pharmacy. There will be no difference to vaping shop sales, as selling nicotine for vaping products is already illegal in Australia. Sponsors/manufacturers cannot advertise unapproved products to the public or health professionals. If the interim decision is made official, the TGA has proposed an implementation date of 1 June 2021. Share",

        "By Alayna Hansen . Nov 19, 2020 0 A A\nAs an Amateur Radio expert, MePACS client Simon loves keeping up with modern technology and communications. So when he saw the MePACS Solo watch , he knew it was the right personal alarm to suit his needs.\nEnjoying his independent lifestyle, he wanted a personal alarm watch that was discreet and convenient, with automatic falls detection and 24/7 monitoring by an emergency response service.\n“My main concern is obviously having a safety measure in place when I have a fall. There’s been many times where I’ve tripped and found myself on the floor with no phone or way to contact someone within reach. The fact that the MePACS Solo is a wearable personal alarm means I can wear it wherever and whenever I want.”\nSimon worked in security management for 30 years and volunteered his time with the Country Fire Association (CFA) to help with radio communications during emergencies and search and rescues. However, with such physical work, he found that his knee was becoming weaker over time.\n“I’ve had a couple of falls recently where I’ve used the MePACS Solo to signal for emergency help, and I knew the response team were guaranteed to answer. They did so very quickly and then stayed on the line and talked to me until carers and the ambulance arrived. It was very comforting to know they would wait until I got the help I needed – that’s more than I could ask for.\n“In one particular fall, I was knocked unconscious and the next thing I know, the paramedics were right there in front of me. With the MePACS Solo , I have the guarantee that help will arrive, so I don’t have to worry as much.”\nNow prone to falls , he used his funding from the National Disability Insurance Scheme to purchase the personal alarm watch.\n“I wanted a personal alarm with a trained response service because I couldn’t count on people to answer their phone at any given time. Knowing that I always have support from MePACS at the tap of a finger makes me feel more secure in my own home. I also have more confidence to go out for a walk as the watch has GPS location technology.”\nSimon uses his MePACS Solo watch to its full potential, keeping an eye on his sleep and heart rate with the intuitive health metrics .\n“I like to keep up with modern technology so I am familiar with how a smart watch works and personally find it easy to use. I think it’s quite interesting that a personal alarm can track my heart rate and sleeping pattern, which is certainly helpful in monitoring my health.”\nSimon’s caring and friendly nature carries across the airwaves.

        "by Jessie Tu | 7 hours ago\nIn April this year, Dolly Parton contributed research funding to US biotech firm Moderna’s experimental vaccine that has this week announced is 94.5 percent effective in preventing COVID-19 based on interim data.\nThe singer contributed $1 million in donation to the Vanderbilt Institute for Infection, Immunology and Inflammation at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville which has helped support the development of the vaccine. A spokesperson from Vanderbilt said Parton’s “generous” gift was helping “several promising research initiatives”.\nAnnouncing her donation on Instagram in April, Parton remarked: “My longtime friend Dr Naji Abumrad, who’s been involved in research at Vanderbilt for many years, informed me that they were making some exciting advancements towards that research of the coronavirus for a cure. I am making a donation of $1 million to Vanderbilt towards that research and to encourage people that can afford it to make donations.”\nThat month, The Guardian reported that the 74-year old’s $1 million also went into a number of research papers, including a convalescent plasma study, that treated coronavirus sufferers with the plasma of people carrying antibodies against COVID-19.The Dolly Parton Covid-19 Research Fund was listed as one the funders in an initial report into Moderna’s vaccine which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine earlier this month. According to early data , Moderna’s vaccine is nearly 95 percent effective and highly effective in stopping people getting ill and worked across all age groups.Researchers announced that a separate preliminary trial last week declared the vaccine to be 90 percent effective at treating the virus which has so far claimed more than 249,000 lives in the US and 1.3 million people globally.Parton told NBC’s Today show , “I’m just happy that anything I do can help somebody else,” she said. “Let’s just hope we find a cure real soon.”\nParton has publicly declared she is “very honoured and proud” to contribute to research into one of the leading Covid-19 vaccines across the world. Overnight, she spoke on BBC One’s The One Show, saying she was “so excited” to hear the news and that she was “sure many millions of dollars from many people went into that.”“I just felt so proud to have been part of that little seed money that will hopefully grow into something great and help to heal this world. I’m a very proud girl today to know I had anything at all to do with something that’s going to help us through this crazy pandemic.”Appearing on NBC’s Today Show, the star added: “What better time right now, we need this. I felt like this was the time for me to open my heart and my hand, and try to help.”Cambridge, Massachusetts based firm Moderna, along with Pfizer, are the only two US-companies which have reported promising vaccine results, anticipating authorisation for emergency use as early as December this year.\nModerna’s vaccine, which began trials back in March, can be stored at normal fridge temperatures that ought to ease distribution logistics. Moderna’s President Stephen Hoge said in a telephone interview with SBS “We are going to have a vaccine that can stop COVID-19.”Hoge told The Associated Press earlier this week, “That should give us all hope that actually a vaccine is going to be able to stop this pandemic and hopefully get us back to our lives. It won’t be Moderna alone that solves this problem. It’s going to require many vaccines” to meet the global demand.\nVanderbilt University Medical Center spokesperson John Howser said Parton’s donation is supporting a plasma study and research involving antibody therapies.\n“Her gift provided support for a pilot convalescent plasma study that one of our researchers was able to successfully complete,” Howser told BBC News. We just announced that the European Medicines Agency has begun a rolling review of mRNA-1273, our mRNA vaccine candidate against COVID-19.

Two of these antibodies are now being tested by a global pharmaceutical firm.”\nParton has a long history of philanthropy and charity. Her Dollywood Foundation , which she began in 1986, has supported numerous child literary initiatives. She has also given to and raised money for wildlife and HIV/Aids charities, including American Eagle Foundation , Barbara Davis Center for Childhood Diabetes, Save The Music Foundation and Cancer Research UK. A post shared by Billboard (@billboard)\nOn December 10, Parton will be honoured with the Hitmaker Award at the 15th annual Billboard ’s Women in Music event which will be live stream ed. Parton will be recognized for her contribution toward impacting the culture, inspiring female songwriters, and writing just as many hits as her male counterparts. I couldn't resist trying it immediately, though I had to sing a bit more quietly than I typically would—for this tune in particular—because my family's all asleep right now. But you can see it scans, good enough for country at least! pic.twitter.com/joQL29e7Uk — Ryan Cordell (@ryancordell) November 17, 2020\nOvernight, Parton has had her famous song “Jolene” transformed by Northeastern University associate English professor Ryan Cordell, who recorded a version renamed “Vaccine,” with different lyrics;“Vaccine, vaccine, vaccine, vaccine/ I’m begging of you, please go in my arm/ Vaccine, vaccine, vaccine, vaccine/ Please just keep me safe from COVID harm,” Cordell sung in a video he posted on Twitter.The lyrics were written by linguist and author Gretchen McCulloch. Cordell told The Boston Globe yesterday that he “loves that song.”“I love Dolly Parton. I And I don’t know — I was inspired, so I went and grabbed my guitar.”",

        "A proposal to scrap GP mental health treatment plans and replace them with an online assessment tool would undermine the holistic approach needed to care for patients with mental health concerns, AMA President, Dr Omar Khorshid said.\nThe proposal is among the recommendations of the Productivity Commission’s long-awaited Mental Health Inquiry Report, which calls for a $2.6 billion overhaul of the system, estimating the total cost of poor mental health and suicide to be as much as $70 billion per year.\nDr Khorshid said the report recognises the crucial role that GPs play in delivering frontline mental health care, but then delivers proposals that result in diminished support for this role.\n“The AMA welcomes the report’s aspirations for a person-centred mental health care system, focusing on prevention and early help – both early in life and early in illness,” Dr Khorshid said.\n“But we cannot accept recommendations that take away support for GPs at a time when the burden of mental illness is growing.”\nThe report highlights the fact that GPs are the first port of call for Australians seeking mental health support, with one in five Australians having a mental health consultation with their GP every year, and a satisfaction rate of more than 80 per cent.\nDespite this, the report offers little in the way of extra support, other than the introduction of a Medicare item for GPs to get advice from a psychiatrist about a patient in their care.\nIn proposing to abolish Medicare-funded GP mental health treatment plans, the Commission puts forward an alternative model where patients would be assessed using an online tool. While the Commission sees this being used by GPs in collaboration with their patients, its recommendation also allows patients using this tool to bypass their GP altogether at a time when holistic care is so important.\nThe AMA would have liked more emphasis on the patient-centred medical home in the report as the ideal model for people seeking care for their mental health.\n“Under this model, psychologists, mental health nurses and social workers can all be integrated into the patient’s health care as part of a well-coordinated and holistic model of GP led care,” Dr Khorshid said.\nThe report’s recommendations are extensive, and the AMA is reviewing them in detail.\nRead the full media release here .\nRead the AMA 10-Year Framework for Primary Care Reform here .

        "How to see the Christmas lights safely this year: a state by state guide Tesco – No Naughty List\nUK supermarket chain Tesco addressed the elephant in the room — the global pandemic — but in a cheeky way.\nRather than making it about the sadness of the year gone by, Tesco is encouraging everyone to take on the holidays guilt-free by telling everyone there is \"no naughty list this year\". Marks & Spencer – This is M&S Christmas Food\nThis ad is all about indulgence over the holidays with the finer and more decadent things this supermarket has to offer.\nThe ad is voiced by The Crown star Olivia Colman, so it's perhaps not entirely by accident that they talk about the brand's gin first up — given it's said to be Queen Elizabeth's favourite tipple. Sainsbury's - The Gravy Song\nThis supermarket chain's big Christmas commercial feels a little like it's been inspired by TikTok meets the Kardashians.\nLots of family moments caught on camera to re-iterate how special the holidays can be surrounded by loved ones, while a father and daughter are overheard talking on the phone and hoping they can meet this year ('cause... COVID). Lidl - Big on a Christmas you can believe in\nThis UK supermarket chain pokes fun not only at the pandemic but at Christmas ads in general — their competitor Aldi's ad in particular when talking carrots. McDonald's UK - Inner Child\nMcDonald's UK has gotten nostalgic this year.\nThe fast food giant's animated ad shows a mother struggling to connect with her teenage son who thinks he's too cool for Christmas. Disney – From Our Family to Yours\nThis is another animated one (what else would you expect from Disney?), and it hits you with all the feels.\nGet the tissues ready before watching this one. Coca-Cola Christmas Commercial 2020\nCoca-Cola, rumoured to have invented Santa's red outfit in a Christmas commercial back in the 1930s, is back with a big budget blockbuster this year.\nIt shows the lengths a father will go to after forgetting to post his daughter's letter to the North Pole. Pepsi Max – Refresh Your Christmas\nPepsi isn't competing with Coke on budget or scale, but instead offering a slogan that challenges its soft drink rival.\nThe ad encourages people to try something different over the holidays, saying \"Traditional is cliche\". Amazon - The Show Must Go On\nAmazon has opted for a feel-good commercial but one firmly centred around the pandemic (which, of course, got lots of people shopping for more online this year).\nAfter a young girl's ballet is cancelled, the whole community rallies together for their sentiment that \"the show must go on\". Advent calendars to make your run to Christmas more festive",

        "The South Australian COVID-19 outbreak highlights the need for all Australians to remain vigilant and be tested for the virus, AMA President Dr Omar Khorshid said.\nThe rapid escalation of cases linked to the Adelaide cluster – from four infections to 17 within two days – is of particular concern, Dr Khorshid said.\nSouth Australia has moved to open up significantly after a long period of no community transmission, which makes the community more vulnerable to outbreaks as a result.\n“There is no doubt that people are becoming more complacent as restrictions ease and governments aim for ‘COVID-normal’ by Christmas,” Dr Khorshid said.\n“We must accept that until there is an effective vaccine, we must live with restrictions and remain COVID-cautious.”\nRestriction fatigue, falling numbers of infections and mixed government messaging all appear to be contributing to people becoming complacent, resulting in the significant drop in COVID testing cross many parts of the country.\n“Getting a COVID test is fundamental to being able to keep COVID-19 contained,” Dr Khorshid said.\nDr Khorshid said even if people only have one COVID-19 symptom, or their symptoms are quite mild, they should still get tested.\n“When you have symptoms, you should also self-isolate until you get a negative test result – this includes staying away from work,” he said.\n“People in self-isolation can still access medical care, with telehealth services available under Medicare.”\nGovernments must also keep the community informed about COVID-19 with simple and clear messages that explain the risks associated with the virus.\n“Testing, the rapid reporting of results and contact tracing are central to our COVID-19 response, and the effective resourcing of these must remain a priority for all governments.”\nThe AMA communique on COVID-19 and the measures required to tackle the virus and support economic recovery is available here .\nRead the full media release here .

        "Whether you are supporting a leadership team that manages across geographical borders or working with a culturally diverse team at home, your ability to influence and collaborate with others is crucial to your success.\nCultural sensitivity is the differentiator between creating cultural cohesion or allowing diversity to divide. Research demonstrates that cultural intelligence may be the single greatest difference between thriving in the 21st-century world and becoming obsolete. Forbes lists cultural intelligence amongst the top 10 most important skills every company will be looking for in 2020.\nUnderstanding your cultural values is the first step towards developing cultural sensitivity. All of us have cultural preferences that are shaped in childhood. These are not good nor bad, or right or wrong, but rather determine the way we prefer to work and live. By understanding your orientations, you can develop insights that help increase your interpersonal effectiveness and bridge gaps with people of different cultures.\nAre you collaborative or expressive?\nPeople who are cooperative will typically focus more on collaboration and establishing relationships before getting to the task at hand. Someone with a competitive orientation will tend to focus on the task and seek individual recognition for achieving results.\nMost western businesses are largely organised around a competitive orientation, it’s about survival of the fittest. This preference encourages a task focus. In Confucian Asian countries such as China, business interactions can typically involve long lunches and multiple courses that don’t involve any business talk as the emphasis is on building the relationship first.\nConsider how your team members demonstrate their preference and if this varies across cultures in your group. Do some team members seek to establish rapport before getting to the task? Or do others have a more direct approach?\nWhat is your communication style?\nConsider how in Australia, it is culturally acceptable—in fact, expected—of individuals to express views in the workplace. Discussion and debate and even explicit expression of disagreement are the norm. In contrast, rarely in Japan, India, and South Korea would an individual openly communicate a difference of opinion in a group setting—especially where seniors are present. A convention of hierarchy holds strong in such cultures where leaders and elders within family, community, and business are held in high regard. The culture is one of promoting harmony and silence represents respect.\nTo obtain viewpoints from across a team, you may consider offering alternative ways for them to share information with you. Scheduling a private conversation before or after a team meeting can solicit input that may otherwise not be presented if they are averse to direct conflict or staying quiet in respect of the formal hierarchy within a group.\nHow expressive are you?\nEmotions vary across cultures—both in expression and meaning. As we cross cultures and encounter emotional expression different from our own, we need to develop a deeper understanding of these emotional landscapes.\nConsider how in Italy outward demonstration of passion and enthusiasm are the norm in the workplace. In Japan, for example, individuals are not emotionally expressive and can be extremely difficult to read. Their communication pattern is very indirect and far less verbose than that of Latin European or Latin American cultures. The Japanese do not gesture very much while speaking, their body language is largely restrained.\nInterpreting true meaning can be challenging and calls for multiple open-ended questions to seek clarification. It is important to slow down, check in on your assumptions and clarify any visual gestures through open dialogue to avoid potential confusion.\nGaiti Rabbani\nGaiti is a well-travelled CQ Specialist, Trainer and Facilitator native to the UK, residing in Australia.

        "UPDATE\nAt 5 am this morning workers at Coles Smeaton Grange warehouse in New South Wales started 24-hour rolling work stoppages to improve redundancy in the face of coming automation.\nIn an aggressive response from the company, workers have now been told that Coles is locking them out until February 11, 2021.\n“This morning, within hours of the strike commencing Coles advised its Smeaton Grange workforce that they would be locked out of the workplace without pay for three months,” said Logistic Director Matt Toner.\n“This is a cruel and heartless decision that will see essential workers, workers that Coles and government praised so highly during the pandemic, go without pay during Christmas and the New Year.\n“The UWU is skeptical that Coles will be able to service its Sydney supermarkets while they have locked down their largest NSW warehouse.” Mr Toner said.\n–\nColes workers strike in New South Wales\nWorkers at Coles’ largest NSW warehouse will begin strike action today in a battle for their jobs in the face of automation. Over 350 workers at the distribution centre in Smeaton Grange are members of the (UWU) and voted to take rolling 24 hour stoppages after negotiations stalled in October.\nWorkers are seeking improved redundancy entitlements, the right to transfer to the new Coles warehouse, job security in the form of a permanent to casual ratio and an increased wage offer.\n“Workers at Coles Smeaton Grange are taking action today because they’re fighting for the right to have a job,” said UWU Logistics Director Matt Toner.\nColes is currently building a new automated warehouse but so far have refused to give skilled and long-serving warehouse workers in Smeaton Grange an opportunity to be redeployed to the new warehouse. Some of these workers have worked for the company for over 30 years.\n“Coles’ intention to automate is anti-community in its mindless pursuit of profit. Workers want the right to keep their job at the new facility and if not want to be respected for the many years of service they have given to ensure Coles’ profits, even throughout this global pandemic.” Mr Toner said.\n“Automation is a historically significant challenge facing workers across the world right now. Workers at Smeaton Grange, and across the Coles supply chain, are demanding to be respected by a multi-billion dollar company as it changes the world of work in ways never seen before. Workers want a just transition. For many nearing the end of their working lives, finding another job will be difficult and finding another full-time permanent job could be impossible. Coles has a responsibility to workers that have given so much.”\nWorkers are calling for forced redundancies to be paid at 5 weeks per year of service, capped at 104 weeks.\nLast year, Coles offered improved redundancies at its 3 NSW distribution centres that would be closed down but withdrew the offer after some members rejected it.\n“Coles can meet workers’ request for a modest increase and improved redundancy, we know they can. Holding out against workers feels like a slap in the face, especially when Coles’ CEO increased his remuneration by 29 per cent in one year and the company has been making mega-profits off the back of essential workers throughout the global pandemic,” said Mr Toner.\nWorkers will be voting on whether to continue the 24-hour stoppages over the coming days. Coles has threatened workers with a three-month lockout.\n“With one of its largest warehouses in NSW out of action, it’s hard to see how there will not be disruptions to supply especially over this busy Christmas period.” Mr Toner said",

        "The evolution of the workplace shows the hybrid worker is on the rise and here to stay November 19, 2020 0 Australian workforce praise employer efforts amid chaos of 2020\nWhile many Australian businesses had to implement a new way of working when COVID-19 social distancing regulations came into play, The Evolving Workplace Report by Choosi shows these changes have led to more than half (54.1%) of Australian workers transitioning to remote and hybrid working models, as well as an increase in job satisfaction (83.1%).\nIn fact, a large majority (92.4%) of the country’s hybrid and remote workers are appreciative of how their employers dealt with this transition. At the same time, more than four in five (83.3%) of these workers report how much they love working from home, with a similar amount (81.5%) agreeing that working from home is a change that’s here to stay.\nThe Evolving Workplace Report by Choosi is part of an ongoing research series that explores the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Australian workforce.\nNearly half (49.0%) of remote or hybrid workers report that working from home has increased their productivity. More interestingly, a large proportion (95.5%) believe this increase in productivity is sustainable for the longer term.\nFollowing this large-scale social experiment, three-fifths (67.6%) are confident their employers will continue with flexible work arrangements and feel as though they’ll want to take advantage of these post-pandemic.\nShadé Zahrai, career and workplace performance expert and keynote speaker on resilience, transformation and leadership, shared her comments on the future of the hybrid and virtual workforce:\n“If employers take heed and move to a hybrid-virtual workforce, this will have considerable impacts on the future of work. Some of the challenges include the need to mitigate the negative impacts of working from home by finding ways to increase employee engagement, encourage greater collaboration and teamwork, roll-out proper training of leaders to manage remote teams, integrate learning and growth experiences for employees, and develop innovative and engaging ways to spruce the ‘boring’ dynamics of video meetings to reduce ‘Zoom fatigue’.”\nWhen it comes to employee mental health and general wellbeing, Australians have high expectations of their employers supporting these needs. Nearly three-quarters (74.5%) of remote or hybrid workers highlight that it’s either a critical responsibility, or at least partly their employer’s responsibility to back these areas. Fortunately, two-thirds (66.7%) state their workplace has done enough to support these aspects during the pandemic.\n“Given the increase in anxiety and uncertainty around job security, it’s imperative that organisations develop and implement specific frameworks to address mental and general wellbeing, which will continue to be an important aspect of the employee experience and a necessity for organisational culture and wellbeing,” Zahrai added.\nWhen it comes to the transition back to the workplace, close to three-in-five (59.4%) believe it could be challenging. The key hurdles anticipated include getting used to a routine again (55.9%), safety fears (50.5%), dealing with commuting (46.1%), and loved ones/pets adjusting to them being gone again (36.3%).\nOut of over 1,300 respondents to The Evolving Workplace by Choosi survey, four in 10 are permanently on-site, meanwhile three in 10 are permanently at home/remote. The remainder are working between the two locations or have since returned to work after a period of remote working.",

        "Ben Fordham isn't the sort of bloke to wear a cape\"> Ben Fordham isn't the sort of bloke to wear a cape , as stylish as he is, but we're thinking he ought to start after coming to the rescue of a stressed-out bride this morning who was facing the prospect of getting married without her beloved brother in attendance, and two bridesmaids down.\n\"Oh my God it's been the most ridiculous 24 hours or even longer,\" Cassie Brien, 30, tells 9Honey. \"I'm exhausted just from this morning, but I'm over the moon after what's happened today.\"\nHer brother Patrick, 28, and his partner Madeline are New South Wales residents but became stranded in Victoria during the coronavirus pandemic . With lockdown lifted the couple had been applying for permission to enter the state in time for Sunday's nuptials but had been unsuccessful. Patrick and Madeline have been stuck in Victoria due to the pandemic. (Supplied)\nAdded to that, two of Cassie's bridesmaids weren't able to make it either - one who lives in Canada and one who lives in South Australia and was about to board a flight to Sydney with her family when the six-day lockdown was announced there.\nCassie and Patrick were devastated he wouldn't make it to the wedding but had accepted it was the case.\n\"We got so close,\" she says. \"We had tried everything but just had to come to terms with it.\"\nFor a daily dose of 9Honey, sign up here to receive our top stories straight to your inbox Patrick was unable to gain approval to enter NSW in time for his sister's wedding. (Supplied)\nThat's when Cassie's best friend Brittany Jarochowicz, 32, reached out to 2GB Live host Ben Fordham for help.\nRELATED: Bridesmaid threatens bride with legal action over cancelled wedding\nCassie got through to Fordham this morning and explained the situation to a sympathetic Fordham. The call ended with Brittany thinking that was that. There was nothing anyone could do to help her. We are in the middle of a pandemic after all. Brittany (left) reached out to Ben Fordham to help with Cassie's wedding dilemma. (Supplied)\nCassie and Brittany were in the middle of a pilates class just hour later when Brittany's phone rang. It was New South Wales Health who has been contacted by Fordham for help to bring Cassie's brother Patrick to Sydney in time for the wedding.\nBrittany says she was shocked to receive the call. Brittany and Cassie have been best friends since childhood. (Supplied)\n\"NSW Health rang me and told us it had been organised and Cass is beyond ecstatic,\" she says. \"Then Ben Fordham rang her brother and now Patrick has a written letter of approval for both of them.\"\nBrittany is so grateful to Fordham for his help.\n\"I always listen to 2GB and my friends laugh at me about it but I learn so much from talk back and he's so easy to listen to. I'm just super-grateful to Ben and NSW Health, they are absolute legends.\"\nListen to Ben Fordham talk to Brittany this morning on Ben Fordham Live on 2GB. Article continue.\nCassie is thrilled with the outcome and has even managed to find replacement bridesmaids for the event.\n\"Luckily one of my amazing beautiful friends Marla is jumping in for my friend in Canada and my sister-in-law is jumping in for my friend in South Australia,\" she says.\nWhile Marla's bridesmaid's dress had already been sorted another one was needed to replace the one left stranded in South Australia after the borders and post offices closed. Cassie and Jay will be married on Sunday with Patrick and his partner in attendance. (Matt Ashton Photograhy)\n\"I got the dresses from Sheike last summer and I asked if they might have another one in one of their stores and we found it in a mid-city store for $50,\" she says.\nCassie and her family is thrilled Patrick is coming to the wedding. She says lockdown has been hard for him and his partner.\n\"It's been a crazy time for them for their mental health,\" she says.\nWhen it was announced that the borders between Victoria and NSW would open on November 23, the family made peace with the fact Patrick would arrive a day after the wedding, although they had decided to drive to the border earlier on the off chance they may be let in earlier and make it to at least part of the wedding. Both Britanny and Cassie have called Ben Fordham a 'legend'. (Supplied)\n\"Then when they found out this morning they could come they were beside themselves.,\" Cassie says. \"It's real, it's happening.\n\"Their lease is nearly up and they didn't know if they were going to be homeless. They had tried everything and had contacted everyone they knew for help.\"\nThe wedding will take place on Sunday at Bowral and thanks to Fordham it is going to be an incredible event.\n\"He's a dead set legend,\" Cassie says of Fordham. \"He's so genuine. He even rang Britt a couple of times after it was all sorted. He's a beautiful human and the health minister is amazing that they can do this for us after such a crazy year.\"\nCassie and Jay met at a backyard party when they were 15 and reconnected three years ago.\n\"We were supposed to be in Mexico and Las Vegas and LA for our honeymoon but I have two stepkids so we'll probably just go down to Mollymook in an Airbnb and when we drop the kids back we'll go to Sydney and eat in our favourite restaurant.\"\nShare your story by emailing Jo Abi at jabi@nine.com.au.

        'To make matters worse, one fateful day Tracey discovered her wedding dress was missing from the room it was in, while her mother-in-law was staying with her. Tracey was mortified to discover her dress was being worn by her mother-in-law. (New Line Cinema)\nWhile preparing the spare room for her future relative to stay, in the 40 minutes it took to make the beds and accommodate Gina, she had snuck off with the gown to try it on.\nTracey explains, "I went to take a bathroom break and headed into the master bedroom...and what do I find but future [mother-in-law] struggling to yank my dress over her head."\n"I blurted out \'what the h*ll?!\' and she immediately started stammering \'Oh my God! OH MY GOD! OH GOD!\'" Tracey adds.\nTracey discovered her mother in law not only in the dress, but with a "bouquet of dried flowers" that had been on the bed before. Tracey quizzed her mother-in-law, only to be equally shocked by her rationale. (Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n"My future fiance is very disturbed by what happened," Tracey writes, speculating, "I think she was actually trying to pretend she was the bride...which for so many reasons, is so wrong."\nStartled by the exceptionally uncomfortable moment, Tracey quizzed her mother-in-law, only to be equally shocked by her rationale.\n"She responded that she was just trying to make sure the dress would fit me; because if the dress fit her, then it would absolutely fit me too," Tracey writes.\n"If it didn\'t fit her, then I obviously had some work to do. Never mind that I just had my final fitting and it had fit like a glove!" The train and zipper had been ripped on the gown. (Getty)\nAs if the moment couldn\'t get worse, Tracey claims her Gina "destroyed" the dress, breaking the zipper and leaving a brown footprint on the back.\nPart of the train was also ripped and Tracey\'s mother-in-law had decided to try the gown on without "wearing underwear".\nRather than offering to pay for the repairs needed to the dress, the mother-in-law proceeded to "lecture" her daughter-in-law for the exorbitant cost of the gown.\n"Clearly the trouble she had getting into the dress was a sign to get something less dramatic and ostentatious," Tracey writes.\nFor a daily dose of 9Honey, sign up here to receive our top stories straight to your inbox',

        "by Dr Jessica Gallagher and Josepha Dietrich | 5 hours ago\nAustralia is officially in recession. With the unemployment rate climbing close to 10% by 2020’s end, we must harness the full potential of our national talent – foster innovation and entrepreneurship to create jobs, and rebuild our economy. A key factor in achieving this lies in addressing the gender imbalance in the entrepreneurial ecosystem, and expanding our number of female founders and leaders.\nThe Australian economy (alone) could grow by about $25 billion if we supported more women into the workforce and empowered them to achieve their full economic potential. Minister for Women, Hon Marise Payne, in the 2020 Women’s Economic Security Statement said, “When women’s individual economic security improves, their participation in work and leadership has flow-on benefits for business, industry, and whole economies.”\nBarriers to female founders and female leaders are well documented and systemic. The Wade Institute of Entrepreneurship found accelerators and incubators improve the chances of startups receiving funding to scale and increase the chances of survival. However, female founders are not well represented in these accelerators. One of Australia’s best-known accelerators, Startmate, revealed their Melbourne 2017 intake had 15 startups, but only one with a female co-founder .\nFurthermore, research in the US and UK points to findings that female-led or co-founded startups have lower failure rates , produce more capital-efficient companies and achieve venture-level returns. However, the Wade Institute revealed that of Venture Capital early stage funding of companies in Australia around 29.4% have at least one female founder, compared to 70.6% of male-only founders.\nWhile a number of programs have been introduced in recent years to encourage and support our female entrepreneurs, such as Advance Queensland’s Female Founders program , and Commonwealth Government’s Boosting Female Founders Initiative , more is needed.\nActivity reports highlight that women are participating in entrepreneurship training programs, but when it comes to accelerating their startup to founding a business attracting money (and gaining traction) they are not converting like their male counterparts.\nAustralian universities could play an important role in changing the narrative, addressing clichés and increasing the number of female founders, leaders and female run startups to improve economic opportunities.\nA joint report between Universities Australia and Startup Muster on Universities and the startup economy finds that more than four in five Australian startup founders are university graduates. They concluded that almost one in five benefited from an acceleration or incubation program; and, with female founders more likely to have a university qualification (89%), and postgrad degree than male founders, university-based accelerators and incubators are perfectly positioned to change the startup economy for female founders. How is one university making a difference?\nAt The University of Queensland (UQ), increasing the number of female students involved in entrepreneurship programs has been a key aspect of its broader strategy. In 2018, UQ introduced LeadHers , a leadership and confidence building program. LeadHers has grown from an initial cohort of 140 in 2018 to more than 360 participating in 2020. It is clear that there is demand from female students to gain skills and networks to support them to build their entrepreneurial mindsets.\nIn 2020, UQ has achieved parity in a number of its entrepreneurship programs, including Idea Hub Unlimited , where students test their early-stage ideas for startups, which has 50% female participation; and, 59% for Social Enterprise Explorer , where students learn key social entrepreneurship tools and methodologies. Acting Manager of UQ’s accelerator, ilab, Emily de la Pena; Senior Manager (Entrepreneurship), Kylie Cooper; founder Rachel Huang; Pro-Vice-Chancellor (Global Engagement and Entrepreneurship) Dr Jessica Gallagher; Entrepreneur in Residence, Sam Jockel; Chief Student Entrepreneur, Rachael Dagge; founder Isabelle Fleming. Photo credit: Josepha Dietrich\nYet while many of the introductory and intermediate programs have seen increased numbers of female participants, when it comes to the University’s accelerator program, the numbers are not as positive. Over the past three to five years, the ilab Accelerator program attracted only 11% of female founders. Why?\nConfidence is potentially one of the reasons. While scholars have debated the extent to which increased confidence actually enhances career prospects, anecdotally the women involved in UQ’s programs say that lacking confidence is a challenge when taking the leap with their ideas.\nThe first female Chief Student Entrepreneur at UQ, Rachael Dagge , notices that young women do not engage as much as their male peers, because they always underestimate themselves.\n“When I interned at a startup in San Francisco every time we went to an event, the men put their hands up so confidently and asked questions, but all the women thought that because they didn’t have absolute expert knowledge in the space they couldn’t ask or they were embarrassed to ask,” said Rachael.\nAnother reason could be the lack of visible role models.\nExpanding programs and achieving 50-50 balances are important, but seeing and hearing examples of others who have walked the path ahead are critical. Significant effort has gone into improving ratios of guest speakers and mentors at UQ, which are around 30% female (the target is 50% by 2022).\nRaising the profile of female founders and successful female entrepreneurs is one way to show women ‘this is possible!’\nThere are young female Unicorns in Australia leading the way, like Melanie Perkins , Founder of Canva, an online graphic design company worth almost $4 billion. Or successful tech startup Envato, a digital assets and services company, that can generate real money – without external investors. Co-founder Cyan Ta-eed was named one of nine women on the 2019 Young Rich List (104 Australians in total). AFR estimates her wealth at $799 million. But we need more examples.\nThe Courier Mail recently profiled ‘Queensland’s 10 most successful start-ups’ and not one female founder was among them, which is a surprise given Queensland’s Chief Entrepreneur is tech founder Leanne Kemp ; who was named one of the top 20 most influential female founders of 2020 . Why is it so important to show women making it as entrepreneurs?\nNot all startups are run by male engineers.\nAfghanistan born, Melbourne-based Samira Tollo an electrical engineering graduate who started her own Fintech startup, Elbaite , at 23, has secured investor capital at a valuation of $3.6 million. She used connections like LeadHers to get guidance on how to run her startup.\n“Having an entrepreneurship community at UQ normalised the career choice I really wanted to make,” said Samira.\n“Especially doing engineering, my peers just wanted a well-paid job.”\nSamira is one of only 14% of females represented in the fintech space .\nWhile at UQ, Samira received awards to help her step into entrepreneurship, such as the Australian Government New Colombo Plan scholarship to intern at a startup in Singapore; and, a Queensland Government Supporting Women Scholarship for women studying in male dominated fields. Plus there is mentorship, funding, and access to opportunities\nCEO and Founder at ParentTV , Sam Jockel, joined UQ Ventures as the first female Entrepreneur in Residence.\n“I would advice any young woman wanting to pursue their own startup to do everything they can to quiet the voice inside them that says they are not enough,” said Sam.\n“Last month, I got a revenue deal (not investment) over the line! This solo female founder and mum of three from Redcliffe signed up a billion-dollar company on a three-year contract using our product across their network of 500 childcare centres.”\nAustralian universities have many of the key ingredients for supporting a richer, more inclusive national innovation and entrepreneurship eco-system. They are built on cultures of discovery; bring the brightest minds from around the world together; and, provide a safe environment for challenging assumptions, testing new ideas and accessing multidisciplinary perspectives.\nChanging the dial requires all components of the eco-system to work together – innovative government programs and policies, support from industry and a vibrant innovation and entrepreneurship culture for our universities.\nThere is no better time to mobilise our female founders and leaders to rebuild our economy, create new jobs and make a positive impact on our global community.\nUQ Ventures will celebrate Women’s Entrepreneurship Day on 19 November. This event is open to the public and free to attend.\nDr Jessica Gallagher is the Pro-Vice-Chancellor, Global Engagement and Entrepreneurship, at The University of Queensland.

        "by Sheree Rubinstein | 6 hours ago\nWe all have our COVID-19 survival stories. And, let’s be honest, many are still right in the midst of a survival mode.\nI want to share my story with the intention of offering a glimmer of hope and motivation to other women, and particularly founders out there, who have or are trying to launch or pivot their businesses.\nI am the Founder of One Roof and Oneline. We design virtual and physical spaces with a mission to reshape the world of work for women. That has really taken on new meaning in the wake of this global pandemic.\nI founded One Roof 6 years ago by accident. Coming from a corporate law background I never knew or intended to start my own business. But here I am 6 years later. In hindsight it made perfect sense. I literally grew up in a business. My parents ran their own business from home. Our living room became an office with 7 or so staff, Monday to Friday, 7am – 7pm. I think I was born with an entrepreneurial spirit. It just took me a while to find it.\nAnd despite the endless challenges. The tears. The fears. The self-doubt. The ridiculously late nights and long working weekends. The countless mistakes. The rock bottom moments. And then the realisation that what you thought was the lowest actually just got lower.\nHonestly, I wouldn’t change it. A bustling and thriving space for women\nMy proudest achievement to date has been turning an old and empty building on City Road, Southbank into a bustling and thriving co-working space for women. I remember the day I moved into that building in early 2016. The building was earmarked for redevelopment. The landlord warned me I would have about 18 months before their permits would come in and I would need to vacate.\nGrateful to property developers Central Equity for the opportunity I knew I just had to get cracking. Thankfully to my very handy father and partner most of the fit-out was DIY. We painted the walls, sourced furniture and set up what very quickly became “Australia’s leading co-working space for women.”\nAll of a sudden people began pouring in. We had to keep moving things around as we kept running out of meeting rooms, the loft became an office, and we added and removed walls to accommodate growing teams. At times it felt frustratingly scrappy and yet, for the most part, it just worked.\nWe had at least 150 tenants in and out of the building every day and hosted on average 5 events per week in our 200-person event space. I don’t quite know what the turning point was, but it quickly became clear that One Roof was a fully-fledged co-working and event operation supporting hundreds, even thousands, of women every year.\nBut I always knew my time was limited. I was waiting for that call and that day when we would need to vacate.\nIt wasn’t until nearly four years later in November 2019 when we officially vacated the building. It’s hard to put into words the feeling that washed over me on the very last day I was in there. This was a site I had literally laboured over for four years. And then in an instant it became an empty space with no people, no buzz and all of the furniture sold. The next chapter\nI walked away with a heavy heart and the fondness of memories. Though, of course, not before an epic “Goodbye Southbank party” with everyone who had been involved, supported and touched by One Roof over the years.\nI knew I had two options and had to move quickly: Find a landlord who could offer me a similar below-market deal or; Raise capital and go all in on a commercial lease.\nI pursued both options at the same time and became obsessed with finding the perfect flagship site; one we could truly call “the home for women.” As I dug deeper into the world of capital raising I became laser focused on finding my ideal investors. And I can say I absolutely achieved my goal.\nI raised capital with a group of investors who believed as strongly in the One Roof brand and mission as I did. A group of predominantly female investors , which is a very rare achievement, but not surprising given One Roof’s vision and values.\nThey were excited to support me in bringing my vision to life. And, in fact, all my investors – both male and female – gave me great support, advice and encouragement along the way. An Australian version of The Wing\nWe set out to create a permanent flagship home. A space for women to work, retreat, connect and thrive. Designed by and for women the space would have a business lounge, break out areas, event space, private studios, meditation area, breastfeeding room and meeting rooms named after trailblazing women. The Wing was my inspiration. They were having huge success and I was completely inspired and motivated to create an “Australian” version.\nBut what came with setting up co-working spaces meant becoming an expert in commercial property. This was a fairly new arena for me and I am definitely not an expert. With support from a small team of advisors, I literally pounded the pavement to secure a site that matched the perfect vision I had in my head. As commercial rents continued to rise I found myself in a very difficult position.\nI felt I had run out of time. We had become a co-working operator without a co-working space and a dispersed community. But finally, when I had reached the point of feeling like I had completely failed at my mission, a unique opportunity presented itself. A site in Cremorne. The ideal size, location, layout and amenities. It was expensive. It was a risk. But it was a reasonable and calculated risk and it matched my vision. I was going all in.\nIt was game on. I was running on adrenalin and lots of coffee. I was 7 months pregnant and positively distracted with the new chapter of One Roof. I signed a Heads of Agreement, hired staff, engaged architects and a builder, and was so excited to receive the first round of concept drawings. It was all finally coming to life. And then COVID-19 happened\nBut then everything grounded to a complete halt. The world stood still. I was meant to moderate a large event at The Rialto for International Women’s Day. When I received the news that the event had been cancelled due to COVID-19 I sensed that this was really serious.\nAmongst all of this, and one week into the first lockdown in Melbourne, I became a mum. Goldie was born, and I was busy.\nAs I came out of those first couple of months of motherhood I began talking to investors and realised a big shift was taking place. Initially I kept saying to them, to myself and to everyone I spoke to, that this was good for the co-working industry and that more people would work from home and as such seek out co-working particularly in local areas. We just had to ‘weather the storm’.\nI still believe this to be the case, but I also couldn’t help but turn my attention to the rising unemployment rate, a seemingly never-ending lockdown and a lot of fear and uncertainty in the air. The world had changed and for the short term so had I. Making a very difficult but prudent decision\nI made one of the most difficult decisions in my entrepreneurial journey to date. I made the call to return all capital to my investors. It felt painfully hard.\nIt takes so damn long for women to raise capital and many never actually get there. I was one of the very few. Globally less than 3% of venture capital goes to women.\nWhile it took me 7 months to raise the capital, once I had decided to return it, it didn’t feel like I had thrown it all in. I have learnt so much and have maintained a very strong relationship with my investors.\nI didn’t want to admit it at first, but the truth was, returning the capital felt right.\nI could no longer put my hand on my heart and tell my investors I was confident about the future of One Roof as it currently stood. And I was in a unique position as I wasn’t operating a space yet. I needed time to observe, test and rework the business model. In fact, they were so supportive and encouraging of my decision. For them, it wasn’t about growth for the sake of growth. They wanted me to take the time to revisit my vision and mission and ensure I felt clear on the next iteration. They are excited and interested to see where I take One Roof in the coming months and years. Pivoting One Roof online\nAt the same time as returning the capital I also made the very swift call to pivot One Roof. The obvious next move for me was to take everything online and offer a virtual membership for women. Everything we provided at One Roof is now all offered through Oneline.\nIn 5 months, we have hosted over 80 virtual workshops, onboarded 200 members and hosted, in partnership with Startup Vic, one of the largest virtual pitch nights this year with 500 registrations and 100 applications from female founders. Our guest speakers have included Sheryl Thai of The League of Extroardinary Women, Jess Ruhfus of Collabosaurus, Penny Locaso of Hacking Happy, Lucinda Hartley of Neighbourlytics and Alex Andrews of Verve Super to name just a few. We have helped members get into accelerator programs, launch crowdfunding campaigns and pivot their business models. Most importantly, our members have access to a team and community obsessing over their success. Our members now span across Australia and globally with members based in NZ and even Japan.\nIn many ways this is just the beginning. A new beginning. I am excited for what is to come for One Roof and Oneline. We have plans to merge our virtual community with a physical presence and launch an offering for corporates. But for now, it’s just one step at a time. One foot in front of the other. Share this",

        "There is a renewed discussion about the role of News Corp in Australia. We also need to consider how to the Murdoch press treats women leaders, writes Blair Williams , Australian National University in this article republished from The Conversation .\nRupert Murdoch’s News Corp has long dominated the Australian media landscape, wielding great political and cultural influence .\nFormer prime minister Kevin Rudd’s record-breaking petition calling for a royal commission into Australian media ownership has once again put this issue in the spotlight. It has gained more than 500,000 signatures and led to a Senate inquiry into media diversity.\nRudd has described News Corp as a “ cancer on democracy ”, while fellow former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has labelled it “ pure propaganda ,” and slammed its “campaign on climate denial”. Labor’s Julia Gillard, has also made similar claims .\nHowever, these discussions fail to consider how the Murdoch press is particularly hostile towards women politicians. How does the Murdoch press represent women?\nWhile studying media representations of women in politics, I’ve noticed a stark difference in Murdoch press coverage of men and women leaders. There is a difference in the way male and female leaders are represented in News Corp papers. Lukas Coch/AAP\nMy research, recently published in Feminist Media Studies , compared Australian media portrayals of Gillard’s prime ministerial rise with that of Helen Clark’s in New Zealand. Both leaders experienced a sexist focus on their gender, appearance and personal lives. But it was far more frequent and intense for Gillard.\nMy research suggests two key explanations for this contrast: the different political contexts they operated in, and the dominating influence of the Murdoch press in Australia versus its absence in New Zealand.\nAs Rudd has argued, the Murdoch press is hyper-partisan and ideologically driven, “ blending editorial opinion with news reporting ”. News Corp is also known to reward Murdoch’s allies, while damaging his enemies .\nYet this has notably gendered ramifications. Murdoch’s conservative morality, traditionalist values, and opposition to left-wing movements appear constantly in his newspapers, making them uniquely hostile to women.\nGillard did not simply threaten the political status quo as Australia’s first woman prime minister. As an unmarried, child-free, atheist woman from the left of the ALP, she also threatened Murdoch’s conservative ideology. His newspaper therefore portrayed Gillard in a highly gendered — even misogynistic — manner intended to undermine her. This was evident in the criticisms of her fashion choices, such as a headline condemning her “technicolour screamcoat” in The Daily Telegraph. Things have not changed since Gillard’s days\nThough it’s been ten years since Gillard became prime minister, not much has changed. News Corp papers continue to attack women in politics, especially if they are from the left.\nQueensland Labor Premier Annastacia is another seasoned veteran of News Corps’ sexist coverage. This includes the Sunshine Coast Daily’s 2019 front page image , which featured Palaszczuk in crosshairs with the headline, “Anna, you’re next”. — Susan Metcalfe (@susanamet) May 20, 2019\nMore recently, The Courier Mail labelled her dealings with Liberal NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian over border closures, “schoolgirl behaviour”.\nEven Liberal women aren’t immune from sexist coverage. Julie Bishop, the Coalition’s former foreign affairs minister, was likened to the power-hungry “Lady Macbeth” by The Australian for her 2018 leadership tilt. She was also ridiculed by the same paper for calling out the Liberal party’s sexist bullying culture.\nBerejiklian has also endured sexist reportage, particularly during the recent scandal over her relationship with disgraced former NSW MP Daryl Maguire. One Daily Telegraph article waxed lyrical about her supposed “wedding fantasy”, a “feminine albeit old-fashioned thing to do” which, they argued, might have kept a workaholic like Berejiiklian “sane”.\nHowever, the News Corp’s partisan bias towards the Coalition is also evident in these stories. Rather than holding Berejiklian to account, the Murdoch press largely ran sympathetic stories about the premier’s behaviour. This starkly contrasts with the onslaught of sexist coverage Gillard received during the AWU affair , which haunted her for the rest of her term in office. International leaders also under attack\nAustralian women aren’t the only targets. The globally popular New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has frequently borne the brunt of biased News Corp coverage.\nIn the lead up to the 2020 New Zealand election, columnist Greg Sheridan argued Ardern doesn’t live up to the hype, claiming in The Australian,\npart of the international Jacindamania comes from the fact she is a young left-wing woman who gave birth in office and took maternity leave.\nSheridan also labelled her government’s COVID-19 response and progressive style of politics as “inherently authoritarian” that also “enjoys bossing people around”.\nWhen Ardern won the election in a historic landslide, The Australian responded with a piece describing her as “ grossly incompetent ” and “the worst person to lead New Zealand through this economic turbulence”. For those who speculated how ‘a Jacinda Ardern’ might do here in Oz, um, asked and answered.(cf nearly every other woman who has an opinion on anything)We are truly so poorly served by our dominant media, which sees itself as a priestly caste, but is mostly a kindergarten. pic.twitter.com/SIO3voDgew — timdunlop (@timdunlop) October 18, 2020\nNotably, the clear bias here drew criticism from the New Zealand press .\nIn August, Johannes Leak’s cartoon in The Australian, also received international condemnation for its misogynistic and racist depiction of vice-presidential nominee Kamala Harris. So how on earth does Murdoch editor Chris Dore justify publishing a racist and sexist cartoon about a US Senator who is likely to be the next Vice-President of the US? Murdoch is a Trump mouthpiece. But this is gross even by Murdoch’s gutter standards. pic.twitter.com/EWwsfEaKOq — Kevin Rudd (@MrKRudd) August 14, 2020 Don’t forget gender\nIt is clear the Murdoch press has a “woman problem”.\nThis poses a real obstacle for women in politics, especially those who oppose Murdoch’s conservative ideology. But it also broadcasts a message about women’s roles and place in society more generally — that no matter how privileged or powerful a woman might be, it’s nearly impossible to escape sexist commentary and the objectifying male gaze.\nThis is why it is so essential to hold the Murdoch press to account in a specifically gendered light.\nBlair Williams , Associate Lecturer, School of Political Science and International Relations, Australian National University\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

        "by Madeline Hislop | 6 hours ago\nKristal Kinsela features on the AGSM @ UNSW Business School’s new ‘Business Of Leadership’ podcast , where guests from business, government, for-purpose and academia share their stories about leadership in today’s accelerated world. Each episode examines leadership in times of complexity and how we can see the world differently, rather than be transfixed by change. (Partner Content)\n“When you’re an Indigenous person in the workforce, you tend to get pigeonholed to work in Indigenous identified roles or Indigenous focused work,” Kristal Kinsela shares in AGSM’s ‘Business of Leadership’ podcast.\nIt’s this kind of classification that Kristal, the owner and managing director of Indigenous Professional Services, works to avoid.\nIndigenous Professional Services is an Indigenous owned consulting company that works with some of the most iconic brands and corporations in Australia. It offers a number of mainstream services that sets them apart from others in the industry.\n“We knew straight away that we had skillsets and capabilities that were different, and we wanted to build a brand and build a reputation off the back of those particular skills and capabilities, that sits separately to us as Indigenous people,” Kristal says.\nIndigenous Professional Services has just celebrated its fifth birthday and has fostered a solid presence and reputation in the consulting industry in this short space of time.\nKristal sits at the helm of the company but didn’t always have such high expectations for her career. She tells Women’s Agenda that when she left high school, she didn’t see herself as someone who would go to university. Instead she just wanted to focus on getting out of her small suburb in Western Sydney.\n“I didn’t see myself as academic enough to go to university, and I just wanted to get out of Doonside,” she shares.\nAfter leaving school, Kristal entered the hospitality industry for a while, but was eventually drawn to enrol in an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander adult education degree– something her aunty had just completed and graduated from.\nIt was this decision that opened up several doors for Kristal and paved her career trajectory forward.\nWhile studying, she landed a role working with Indigenous youth at her old high school and later began teaching at TAFE. She also held student advisor roles at universities before landing a job in policy at NSW Department of Education and Training.\nWith extensive experience across government, corporate and not-for-profit sectors, Kristal then launched Indigenous Professional Services, with a goal of facilitating and delivering programs for clients to create real impact on the ground.\n“The areas I spend a lot of time working with my clients is in procurement, around diversity and employment,” Kristal shares on the podcast.\n“Getting them to really think about, from an employment perspective, how they attract Indigenous people to come and work in their workspace. What does that look like? The environment? How would they support mentor, retain, develop Indigenous staff?”\nShe says that unconscious bias is a still a massive challenge she sees among clients of Indigenous Professional Services.\n“I’m always constantly taking my clients on that journey around understanding what it is, that it actually does exist in workplaces, and how can we navigate through that,” she says.\nShe believes the best way to help people confront their own unconscious bias is to connect it to their own upbringing.\n“Our program is centred around individuals connecting with their own upbringing, personal beliefs and behaviours and connecting it with unconscious bias. We see the greatest results from the training when people are open and willing to own their behaviour and really take steps to mitigate it in the workplace,” she says.\nAs a mother of teenagers, Kristal says her work in helping others confront their own unconscious bias and racism in the workplace has flow on effects in other parts of society.\n“People don’t understand what it is like to be a black person in Australia,” she says.\nAnd while there’s no silver bullet to overcoming racism, Kristal believes sharing Indigenous experiences is essential to creating change. It’s why she wrote this blog post in August , where she explained how she talks to her children about racism.\n“Last night as I watched the news, my 13-year-old son walks in the room just as a police officer is shown tripping the legs of a 17-year-old Aboriginal boy, making him hit the ground hard and arresting him. I turned and saw his face in shock,” she wrote.\n“Not wanting to cotton wool it, I said to my son, ‘son this why I don’t like you walking around the streets, because I fear you’re going to be picked up and abused by the cops because of the colour of your skin’. He said back to me, ‘I know mum, I know’”.\nKristal says many of her clients have read her blog posts, and reach out specifically to ask how they can raise awareness within their organisation about the Black Lives Matter movement and racism.\nLooking to the future, Indigenous Professional Services is looking to scale its geographical presence, and will build an office and team in NSW. Bringing in new Indigenous talent will be essential to this development.\n“We have worked out what we are really good at, and we plan to continue to deliver on these services, and bring in more Indigenous talent that we grow and develop with a pathway to ownership in our business,” Kristal says.\nIn the meantime, her aim is to continue working to encourage corporates and government to do more with Indigenous businesses, and help them implement the changes necessary to promote Indigenous leadership across the board.\n“My legacy will see the growth of our sector and the number of sustainable Indigenous businesses skyrocket. We are the future, and everyone will do business with us.” Share this",

        "If a true entrepreneur is somebody who solves real world problems through business, then Dr Talat Uppal is absolutely it.\nYou won’t find her in the traditional places entrepreneurs are celebrated. You won’t see her on an AFR Rich List. Or as an influencer on Instagram.\nWhere you will find her is at Women’s Health Road , a new kind of women’s health practice that she’s established on Sydney’s Northern Beaches aiming to bring multiple, commonplace women’s health needs into the one space that puts the needs of the patient above anything else. That means you can access obstetrics and gynecology care from Dr Uppal herself, before going next door to see a midwife, a breastfeeding consultant, a perinatal physiatrist, a physiotherapist – with a pelvic floor specialty – an anaesthetist and advance Laparoscic surgeon and fertility specialist.\nThe aim is to create a “streamlined journey for women and their families to be heard and supported in their choices.” Everything is digitally integrated and there are ultrasound facilities on site. Of course!\nWhy is this kind of service the exception rather than the norm? Well, you can take a few guesses there when you consider the segment of the population that has dominated the decisions made on how healthcare is delivered.\nWhat Dr Uppal has created is the kind of care-first problem solving the world needs from entrepreneurship.\nWhile this is not the usual kind of business we highlight when celebrating entrepreneurship, it’s one I want to acknowledge today, on Women’s Entrepreneurship Day. Women’s Health Road is not scalable in the way an app or new tech platform is. She hasn’t sought multiple rounds of investment and her business is service-based rather than product-based.\nBut businesses like Women’s Health Road that focus on creating better outcomes for care, must be the next major frontier of entrepreneurship — up there with those that address climate change. There are numerous areas of care where challenges persist and are therefore ripe for innovation: it’s health care, it’s aged care, it’s childcare, it’s care for those with disabilities, it’s care for those surviving trauma and domestic violence and more.\nAnd women are best placed to lead the entrepreneurial push that will significantly transform these sectors of care.\nNot only because women have long dominated the ranks of those who actually do the caring — whether that’s making up the bulk of care-focused workforces or the caring that’s happening in homes.\nBut also because women in those sectors have seen the challenges that need solving first hand.\nAnd because women-led businesses generate more ROI to investors than startups led by men , and these care sectors simply can’t wait for investors to gamble their money chasing the typical unicorns of the past.\nWomen have been ignored for too long, taking around three per cent of the share of VC capital in 2019, a figure that’s hardly budged in years.\nCurrently, the vast majority of women-led businesses bootstrap their ventures to make them happen. In a small poll of around 200 female founders we ran back in 2019, a massive 94 per cent reported that they’re so far self funded, others talked about using credit cards, loans from family members and government grants. Just one business reported having VC funding, and another two noted they had angel investors. Forty one per cent of all the female founders surveyed said they were still yet to earn a salary from their business.\nWhile women can still create exceptional businesses without investment, it’s slows them down.\nAnd that means we might miss significant opportunities.\nLike opportunities in early childhood education, where Andrea Christie David is proving the time is now to address some key challenges parents have in accessing care. A former human rights lawyer, when Andrea had three children under five and therefore needed to pay three lots of childcare at the one time, she immediately saw a need to innovate around how childcare is delivered. And so she did: establishing a business that enables families to access high-quality early childhood education in the family home. She established childcare startup Leor In Home Early Learning . This business is scalable and it’s growing fast across the country. Andrea Christie-David\nThere are also plenty of opportunities in nursing, where nurses are turning to entrepreneurship, which the Nursing Entrepreneurial Network Australia is aiming to highlight and encourage. An example here is Zara Lord, who still picks up the occasional nursing shift in Queensland but now spends the majority of her time running uPaged, a database that enables nurses to pick up working opportunities as they need and choose .\nThese businesses will not only make situations better for those who need the care, but also for those who do the caring. They are and will provide solutions to the biggest challenges being faced by these sectors.\nIn 2019, the Cherie Blair Foundation in partnership with Boston Consulting Group found that Australia could nab an economic opportunity worth between $71 billion and $135 billion, just by lifting the number of women entrepreneurs to be on par with men.\nIt’s not about the billions. It’s about the care. I want to see female entrepreneurs receiving as much investment and attention as their male counterparts. But I want to see teachers, nurses, doctors, early childhood educators and aged care workers on those lists — and receiving the VC funding they need to make their businesses happen, fast.\nWhen I visited Dr Uppal’s service last week, I walked into a new, fresh and comfortable space where Dr Uppal has overseen every detail to ensure it works for the women who enter the building. It wasn’t long before one her patients, who had travelled across the city to be there, told me that Dr Uppal had “literally saved her life” due to the care she’d provided. Isn’t that the kind of entrepreneur, and the kind of business, that’s worth supporting? Share this",

        "There are 337 gender equity programs and initiatives running nationally in Australia, and many more offered within organisations and at a state and local level. Are they doing their job? Well according to new research, there’s little evidence to say that they do.\nJust seven of these 337 gender equity programs identified have published publicly facing evaluation data, according to the new research out of ANU by Merryn McKinnon and published in the Australian Journal of Social Issues . And just one of those seven includes data that goes beyond self reports of satisfaction and enjoyment.\nThese programs — often supported by Federal Budget funding — are not without merit. Their very presence does at least something to highlight the need to further support and engage women in STEM.\nAnd in many cases measuring their impact is difficult, given they may target high school girls or aim to encourage women and girls into STEM. As research author McKinnon writes, how do you evaluate if a student’s experience of a STEM-related program in school results in her pursuing a career in STEM? Often, given the challenges of such evaluations, there’s an over reliance on “framing and storytelling”.\nThe collective force of these programs together is also beneficial, but again difficult to evaluate, unless you’re purely looking at the impact on the numbers — there’s been a little movement in the past couple of decades, and we’ve seen women rise to major leadership positions in this space, but still not enough has changed.\nIndeed, one glance at the numbers and you see that we are a long way from no longer needing programs and funding to support women in STEM.\nBut are these programs as most are currently framed enough to fix some of the more widespread and systemic issues facing women working in STEM? Issues that can drive highly-educated women out: like sexism, sexual harassment, bias and career progression pathways that fail to fairly support those who take time out to have children or need to work part time or flexibility?\nDespite the work of those working in STEM never being greater during 2020, the Pandemic’s impact has resulted in numerous women in STEM being sidelined, having to step back or down, or out of the workforce all together. As we’ve previously reported on Women’s Agenda, this has been particularly true for early and middle career researchers , especially with the loss of university funding exacerbating the issue (and government support for the sector waning for some time, as three immunologists recently shared ).\nI worry that women in STEM programs, and funding announcements supporting them, can give the impression that something’s being done, and therefore the challenges facing women in such fields are on the way to being solved. Then if we fail to see the progress of such initiatives, we can turn back and say, ‘well the problem was women all along’. But we know from research as well as some of the many brilliant women in STEM, including in some of the country’s top leadership positions, that is certainly not the case. The problem is that the workforce as it currently stands was not created with women in mind. Issues that are further exacerbated in many industries and roles within STEM.\nThis week, an excellent Twitter thread emerged from Dr Amy Heffernan on mentoring as an initiative for driving gender equity for women in STEM. Mentoring is one piece that often features in women in STEM programs, especially those that are created within individual organisations. 1. On mentoring as an initiative to drive gender equity for #womenInSTEM (and NB folk), a thread — Dr Amy Heffernan (@DrHeffo) November 17, 2020\nMentoring’s an important strategy, Dr Heffernan says, but it’s not the answer. It’s no silver bullet. Indeed for many women, an active sponsor would actually be more effective. Dr Heffernan also notes that mentoring program can become simple options to “check the ‘women in STEM” box compared with addressing the more systematic inequities. And without collecting the robust data, we can’t actually assess the effectiveness of these programs (and such data, she adds, need to include a control group, or else we don’t know what to compare it to)\nFinally, she suggests that mentoring as a solution is another means for shifting the responsibility from organisations to individuals.\nWhen it comes to some of the barriers facing women in STEM, it’s possible that programs that aim to encourage more girls into the sector will help in the long run, scholarships will directly support the individual women who win them, and networking initiatives may help improve connections.\nBut what about the women in the sector right now? What about those — especially in 2020 — who simply can’t get over the hurdles placed in front of them? Those who have already studied and started their careers? We invested in these women, and these women gave their time, their expertise and their early years of experience. It would seem the best possible investment would be to do everything possible to ensure that these women can get ahead.\nMcKinnon argues it’s time to shift the focus. To move beyond the delivery of women in STEM programs to instead critically engage with what programs should be offered, to whom and why.\nShe says many of the initiatives that her research examined are “tinkering around the edges”. “Many of these benefit an individual while very few actively address the fundamental, systemic changes which are required to truly bring about equity in STEM.”\nBut she adds that with these collective efforts, there is potential for fundamental change if we can get the “disparate pieces to work together.”\nTo make the most of such collective efforts, McKinnon recommends that policymakers and those responsible for funding decisions aim to support programs that address the big cultural and systemic issues that are outlined in the Decadal Plan for Women in STEM: such as processes around recruitment, grants, promotions, access to parental and carers leave.\nGetting there relies on evidence. Evidence that includes controlled data, as Dr Heffernan suggests. We need to know how to best narrow STEM’s gender gap, otherwise we risk throwing precious and limited resources at the wrong things.

        "Retirement | How much is enough? > Your retirement planning starts here Your retirement planning must start here\nNo plan is a good plan if you don’t know how much your need, writes John De Ravin. Fellow of the Actuaries Institute 19th Nov 2020 PRINT\nRetired actuary John De Ravin has written the ultimate ‘guide’ book for managing money and planning the best possible retirement. In this extract from Slow and Steady: 100 wealth building strategies, he explains how to answer that tough questions – how much do I need? •••\nRead this strategy if: you are approaching retirement and need to estimate your annual spending to provide the lifestyle you would like in retirement (as a prerequisite for calculating the total amount of money you need to have to retire comfortably).\nBackground When you approach retirement, it is natural to consider whether you have ‘enough’ in superannuation and other financial assets to enable you to live the lifestyle that you envisage in retirement. The starting point for this calculation needs to be a slightly simpler question: How much will my desired retirement lifestyle cost?\nThe Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia (ASFA) has developed a Retirement Calculator into which you can put the following details: single male/single female/couple state in which you intend to retire desired lifestyle (‘modest’ or ‘comfortable’) budgeting frequency (annually/quarterly/monthly/fortnightly/weekly).\nThe calculator will then return an amount to support your target lifestyle.\nAlthough the ASFA retirement standard is a helpful indicator, it doesn’t really allow for the range of different lifestyle expectations that people may have in practice, apart from the simple ‘modest versus comfortable’ binary comparison. In practice, some retirees will expect a much higher standard of living than what is implied by the ASFA ‘comfortable’ standard, while others might find the ‘modest’ standard very acceptable. Also as we age, we tend to spend much less on some expense categories such as travel and entertainment, though this decrease may be partially offset by higher medical and care expenses.\nKey point It is a good idea to estimate how much you will spend as the basis of retirement planning. The best way to do this is to apply a two-step process: 1. Work out what your lifestyle costs before retirement. 2. Make adjustments for expected differences between your lifestyle while you are still working and the lifestyle you plan to lead while retired.\nAlternatively, you can ‘start from scratch’ and use a budgeting tool to estimate the costs of your retirement lifestyle. But this is a bit harder because it isn’t ‘anchored’ to the actual costs of your current lifestyle and it is easy to omit some components of expense (especially infrequent expenses and capital items that need replacement at the end of their useful life) due to oversight.\nHow to do it The first challenge is to work out what your current lifestyle costs, if you don’t already know. Assuming that all your income flows into bank statements, then you can review your bank statements over the course of (say) the past year. Your outgoings will be in the nature of: 1. living expenses 2. transfers to other accounts (such as credit card accounts) to pay off living expenses 3. purchases of investments 4. transfers to other accounts to purchase investments 5. mortgage loan repayments 6. personal loan repayments.\nYour annual living expenses are the sum of all items in categories 1 and 2 above, but you should exclude items in categories 3 to 6 on the assumption that by the time you retire you will have paid off all your mortgages and personal loans.\nIf you have more than one account from which you meet living expenses, you can add up the items across the various accounts but, of course, any transfers between those accounts should be excluded to avoid double counting.\nIf you have large non-recurring expenses, which you are sure will not arise again in retirement, then you should exclude those items from your living expenses. (For example, if you contributed $25,000 towards the costs of the wedding of your last remaining single child, you should not include $25,000 as part of your annual living expenses or you will arrive at too high a figure.)\nThe second challenge is to adjust your current expenses to adapt to your post-retirement lifestyle. This means that you will need to:\nRemove or reduce any expenses of activities that you will be doing less of (or not doing at all) in retirement, for example: the cost of dry-cleaning your work clothes\nInsert or increase expenses for activities that you will be commencing, or doing more of, in retirement, for example: increased travel costs, if you plan to travel more domestically or overseas in retirement compared to what you did while you were working increased leisure costs, because you will now have a lot more time on your hands – you will need to do something to occupy yourself for all the time that you used to be at work.\nIt will probably be easier to identify the costs that should be reduced or removed from your lifestyle budget. It may be harder to know what additional expenses you are likely to incur before you actually commence your retirement.\nInstead of analysing your historical expenses, an alternative is to build a budget for your new retirement lifestyle using a budgeting tool available from various apps or websites. A good example is the ASIC MoneySmart website, which is easy to operate and produces an immediate summary that you can print or save under your chosen name (such as ‘Planned Budget 2017’). You will need to create a MoneySmart account to save your workbook but that is very quick and easy to do. You can then log in later to retrieve your saved budget from the MoneySmart website. Alternatively, you can download the Excel version of the MoneySmart budgeting tool and save that directly to your own device.\nThe MoneySmart website also has a simple money manager , which abbreviates the budgeting process to 14 headings – three for income and 11 for outgoings. The money manager also includes audio to help you complete the budget, and the audio is available in nine different languages.\nWhat does it mean for you financially? Creating your own budget is the starting point to knowing how much you need to have saved in order to retire. It means you can now start to consider questions such as: 1. Can I retire now? 2. When can I retire if I want to have $X per year to spend in retirement? 3. How much money do I need to have to retire and live the lifestyle I expect?\nIf you don’t know how much it will cost you to live in retirement, you are at risk of either retiring too soon and finding that your money is likely to run out, or staying in the workforce, which you might not enjoy, when in fact you could afford to live the rest of your life comfortably with the lifestyle you want, without needing to keep earning.\nSlow and Steady is available from John De Ravin’s website for $39.95.\nIf you enjoy our content, don’t keep it to yourself.

        "Health | Your Health > Why you bruise so easily Why you bruise so easily\nAre you always covered in bruises? Here’s why. PRINT\nWhen you damage blood vessels close to the surface of your skin they can leak, creating a darker, more sensitive area called a bruise. You may knock your leg against a table leg and anticipate a bruise, or simply find them along your arms and legs and wonder where they came from. Some people bruise more easily than others, and there are a number of reasons why.\nAgeing As you get older, you begin to lose the fatty layer below the surface of your skin, which helps to protect your blood vessels from harm. With less protection, bumping your shin on your bedframe is far more likely to leave a bruise.\nSun exposure If you’ve spent a lot of time in the sun, it’s likely that the blood vessels on the backs of your arms and hands have been damaged by the exposure, making them weak and more susceptible to bruising.\nDiabetes If you don’t manage your blood sugar levels, over time high blood sugar can damage your blood vessels, making you more susceptible to long-lasting bruises.\nMedicines Blood thinning pain killers such as ibuprofen and aspirin can make it more difficult for your blood to clot, meaning bruises are more likely to form when you hurt yourself. Some steroids can make your skin more fragile, and some antibiotics can make you more susceptible to bruising.\nVitamin deficiency Your body uses vitamin C to produce collagen, which helps to keep your blood vessels strong and healthy. While vitamin C deficiency is rare, it is more common among smokers, and can make you more prone to bruising.\nVitamin K plays an important role in blood clotting. While most healthy adults get enough vitamin K in their daily diet , those who don’t are more prone to bruising.\nFamily history Being susceptible to bruising can run in the family, like other inheritable traits such as hair colour and dimples. Women are also more likely to have delicate blood vessels in the thighs and upper arms, making them more prone to bruising.\nSupplements According to WebMD , taking some supplements including ginseng, garlic and ginkgo can thin your blood, making it harder for your blood to clot to prevent bruising.\nOver exercising If you play contact sports, or overexert yourself when doing exercise, you make create tiny tears in your blood vessels, which can lead to bruising.\nBlood conditions Some rare blood conditions can make you more vulnerable to bruising. A condition called haemophilia prevents your body from making enough proteins for your blood to clot properly, making you bruise easily.\nWhile its very rare, leukemia is another cause of bruising. It can cause your body to produce too many white blood cells, which interferes with your blood, increasing your risk of bruising.\nAlcohol If you drink frequently and find that you bruise easily, it may be a sign that your liver isn’t working as it should be. Liver damage can prevent your liver from producing proteins that help your blood clot when necessary. If you think this may be the case, consult your GP. Remember to be honest about the amount you drink, as your doctor likely knows when you’re lying .\nDo you bruise easily?

        "Australians are embracing new ways of commemorating the dead.\nHannah Harewood Gould\nAre cemeteries just for the dead and remembering them? Is it okay to jog or cycle through a cemetery? Should you be able to listen to live music or to dance among the gravestones?\nLarge metropolitan cemeteries have been common in Europe since the 18th century, when fears about sanitation caused cities to close their overcrowded churchyard burial grounds and move the dead to dedicated sites on the city outskirts.\nResearchers are exploring the potential for cemeteries to be more than traditional places for memorialising those who have passed away. Picture: Claudia Hooper\nThe trend took longer to come to Australia, but as cities like Melbourne became densely populated their cemeteries were gradually moved to the urban fringe, where they now occupy wide areas of land. In 1922, Melbourne’s first major cemetery was closed to make way for the expansion of the Queen Victoria Market and its graves were relocated to suburban cemeteries.\nToday, Australia’s cemeteries are places to respect, remember and contemplate the lives of loved ones for many different communities and faiths.\nBeyond beauty Read more\nHowever, space is at a premium and some of Melbourne’s most well-known cemeteries have few plots remaining. Others are ‘closed’ and have not had a burial since the early 1970s . Graves can’t be disturbed because the rights to them have been granted in perpetuity, placing considerable constraints on the operators and also limiting community use of the space.\nAnthropologist Dr Hannah Gould and the DeathTech team from the University of Melbourne are working to discover and assess the potential of new technologies to enhance the experience of cemeteries, not just for bereaved families, but for wider communities.\nTheir Australian Research Council-funded Future Cemetery Project with the Greater Metropolitan Cemeteries Trust (GMCT) looks at how these existing large public sites could be used for a range of activities that strengthen community connections, and how new cemeteries should be designed to meet future community needs.\n“Melbourne’s public cemeteries are an important part of our local history. But how do we want these spaces to function in future? Can the dead exist alongside public places for art and performance for example?” asks Dr Gould.\nLarge metropolitan cemeteries like the Melbourne General Cemetery replaced earlier small church graveyards. Picture: John O’Neill/Wikipedia\nShe adds that cemeteries have never been just ‘creepy’ places. Historically, they have been used as public art galleries and places for a day out or a promenade. Many Parisian cemeteries are incredibly beautiful, with sites like Père Lachaise Cemetery featuring decorative angels, gorgeous landscaping and famous interments to entice touristes to visit.\nAnd for some cemeteries, their main original purpose in catering to a specific group no longer applies.\nYour online life after death Read more\n“Many cemeteries nowadays contain the remains of communities who no longer populate that area. We see this for example with the Northcote German cemetery,” says Dr Gould.\n“In this sense, there is a tension between what we want to do to protect and preserve those sites to fulfil our obligations to the dead, and how we may want to use the space for the contemporary communities who live in the area.”\nIn a recent survey of 1042 people, supported by GMCT, the DeathTech team found that older people were generally more open to newer ways of using cemeteries. Older people were more likely than younger people to say that the cemetery should be a place to walk the dog, go for a jog, learn about the local area or visit famous graves as a tourist.\nAround a third of people in the survey said that cemeteries should only be used for their traditional purposes of burial and memorialisation.\nThe beauty of cemeteries like Pére Lauchaise in Paris encourages visitors take pleasure in the surroundings. Picture: Peter Poradisch/Wikimedia\nMeantime, around the world cemeteries have begun to adopt new technologies to improve their visitors’ experiences, reduce their environmental footprints, and extend the personalisation of services in response to changing community desires.\nNew technologies include the potential for digital augmentation of grave management and visitation (like way-finding apps), as well as new alternatives to conventional burial and cremation and new designs for landscaping and flora.\nAustralian literature's great silence Read more\nThere is also the potential for real-time virtual offerings from distant loved ones, where an individual could use their smartphone to order items they’d like to see placed at a memorial site and watch that happen online or through augmented reality.\nIn response to social distancing restrictions brought about by COVID-19, GMCT recently introduced a service to order flowers to be delivered to a loved one’s grave.\n“Our research team want to go beyond taboos and learn more about the changes taking place in Australia when it comes to what we want to do with our dead.”\nThere are clear cultural and religious differences. For some cultures it is crucial to bury the dead. Yet in Australia, close to 70 per cent of people say their preference is to be cremated . According to Dr Gould, this preference for cremation is likely driven by the rising costs of burial, land shortages for cemeteries and the largely secular nature of Australia.\nIn Australia, close to 70 per cent of people say their preference is to be cremated. Picture: Georg Lippitsch/Wikipedia\n“Secularism and focus on the individual’s life is a hallmark of many Australian funerals – they’re full of PowerPoint presentations of people’s lives, speeches, and so on. Many are quite nonreligious.”\n“The decision in 1963 by the Catholic Church to endorse cremation as an option has also helped, along with a long history of migration from cultures in Asia where cremation is standard.”\nThe something in nothing Read more\nThe survey suggests a growing acceptance of more ‘eco-friendly’ or natural burial methods among younger respondents. Death-care industries are adapting to this by offering new ways of disposing of human remains.\nFor example, you can now be buried in a suit woven with mushrooms and spores that help to decompose the body faster, helping to (at least in theory) reduce environmental contaminants.\nMeanwhile, to the west of Melbourne there is a smaller cemetery that offers upright or vertical burials that take up less space and are covered in farmland, providing a lower environmental impact than traditional burial sites.\nDiscussing these alternatives can cause discomfort for many people. For example, 22 per cent of survey respondents rated the idea of upright burial very negatively.\n“There can often be a lot of unease with the idea of vertical burial. It’s seen as too restless and with too much movement,” says Dr Gould.\nCOVID-19 has forced people to embrace new technology in funeral settings, like live streaming services. Picture: Polina Zimmerman/Pexels\nBut according to the University of Melbourne survey, the Australian public is relatively open to new ideas. When asked about a myriad of ‘novel’ ways to dispose of a body – including upright burial, natural burial, burial at sea, alkaline hydrolysis in which chemicals and water are used to dissolve soft tissue, human composting and freeze drying to powder (promession) – most respondents reported no negative sentiments.\nThe willingness or unwillingness to adopt new technologies is a keen interest of Dr Gould, who wants to understand how new memorialisation traditions become meaningful and feel ‘right’. The weird world of Christmas traditions Read more\n“In many ways, a ritual tradition holds meaning because it’s repeated. So when you introduce a new way of doing things, how do people invest that with significance and when do people become comfortable with it?” asks Dr Gould.\n“We’ve had the technology to record and livestream funerals for a long time, but it wasn’t widely used because it felt contrary to tradition. With COVID-19 restrictions, we’ve seen people forced to try new things. The real question now is what will people make of those experiences? Now that it’s more familiar, will we see a permanent change?”\nDr Gould emphasises that there are many challenges facing the future of cemeteries in catering to the needs of a diverse community whose preferences may shift significantly from one generation to the next.\nShe says the planning for future cemeteries and places to memorialise the dead will need to consider more than cultural mores, but financial constraints, environmental impact and the potential for community-building sites.\nAnd just like the shift from the small church graveyard to the large metropolitan cemetery, future sites for remembering the dead are likely to be radically different from what we know today.\nDr Hannah Gould and Professor Tamara Kohn are delivering a webinar exploring different experiences of dying, death, disposal and commemoration in a changing world. ‘DeathTech: Redesigning death for the 21st century and beyond’ takes place on Thursday 5 November 2020 and you can register here .\nBanner image: Getty Images\nIf you enjoy our content, don’t keep it to yourself.

        "BD will deliver millions of disposable needles, syringes and sharps collectors over the next 12 months, to support Australia’s COVID-19 Vaccine and Treatment Strategy . The partnership will also ensure sufficient in-country supply, should more injection devices for vaccine delivery be required.\nBD Australia and New Zealand Managing Director and Vice President Anelo Cournut applauded the government for its proactive approach in planning for future pandemics.\n“Today’s first delivery of BD products marks an important milestone for our company. We are proud to be part of an innovative collaboration between government, manufacturers, researchers and clinicians alike.\n“Our collective goal is to guarantee that when the time arrives, every Australian can access a COVID-19 vaccine.\n“BD is committed to ensuring product continuity through our robust and agile supply chain, with local manufacturing partners in Australia and around the globe,” Cournut said.\n“BD will work in close collaboration with the government over the next 12 months to ensure the supply of vital vaccine delivery devices, to enable every Australian to access a COVID-19 vaccine, once available.”\nIn addition to delivering vaccine products, BD is also liaising with the DoH — including the Therapeutic Goods Administration and state healthcare systems — to expand the nation’s access to diagnostic testing and treatment support for COVID-19 patients. This includes swabs for influenza and COVID-19 testing, rapid molecular diagnostic tests using the BD MAX System and 15-minute point-of-care antigen testing with the BD Veritor Plus System.\nIn addition, BD supplies infusion pumps, infusion sets, cannulas, central line catheters and targeted temperature management systems to support ICU patients. Researchers are also using BD Biosciences instrumentation for cellular analysis worldwide, and locally, to better understand the immune response to COVID-19.\nMedical Technology Association of Australia (MTAA) CEO Ian Burgess said Australia’s medtech industry has been recognised for its response to the challenges of COVID-19 to date, particularly for ensuring the ongoing supply of essential medical supplies.\n“The ‘Australian Model’ of industry collaboration with government throughout COVID-19 is the globally recognised benchmark. MTAA, along with industry partners, has been working with government, including The Hon. Karen Andrews MP, Minister for Industry, and The Hon. Greg Hunt MP, Minister for Health, to ensure all Australians have continued access to life-saving and life-changing medical devices.\n“During COVID-19 the government asked medtech to supply 7500 ventilators and over 10 million COVID-19 test kits; the medtech supply chain worked and the ventilators and other essential medical equipment were delivered. Now government has asked for vaccine devices and again medtech delivered,” Burgess said.\nWith more than 65 years of strong history in vaccine delivery, BD has partnered with governments worldwide to produce and supply billions of vaccine delivery devices. Importantly, due to the company’s strong manufacturing capacity and well-established global supply chain, BD will still be able to prioritise existing customer requirements for needles and syringes, including for influenza vaccination programs.\nImage credit: ©stock.adobe.com/au/Rido",

        "Drug-resistant UTIs: the canary in the coalmine Thursday, 19 November, 2020\nNew research reveals that one of the world’s most common infections will cost Australia more than $1 billion a year within the next decade if nothing is done to stop the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Analysis by national consortium OUTBREAK highlights how urinary tract infections (UTIs) are becoming more persistent and harder to treat, resulting in more people being admitted to hospital where they require longer stays and more costly medicines.\nOUTBREAK Managing Director Associate Professor Branwen Morgan said drug-resistant UTIs were the canary in the coalmine for a growing number of antibiotic-resistant germs spreading in our community, animals and environment.\n“Drug-resistant infections are a global health threat but this is the first time we’ve been able to connect the overuse and misuse of antibiotics to the health and economic impact of a single disease,” Associate Professor Branwen Morgan said.\n“UTIs affect one in two Australian women and one in 20 men in their lifetime, currently resulting in more than 2.5 million GP appointments, 100,000 emergency department visits and 75,000 hospital stays each year.\n“We found that UTIs already cost Australia’s health system $909 million per year, not including indirect costs such as lost productivity. If we do nothing to stop the rise of antibiotic resistance, that figure could easily hit $1.6 billion by 2030.\n“Those figures are very conservative and don’t take into account the increasing numbers of people with UTIs, so realistically it could cost much, much more than that.” OUTBREAK is a multi-institutional and transdisciplinary initiative, led by the University of Technology Sydney , helping solve the growing threat of antibiotic resistance by using big data and AI to determine a location-specific and person-specific risk of a drug-resistant infection now and in the future.\nThe calculations were devised using a combination of national and regional data from the Illawarra Shoalhaven Local Health District (ISLHD) for the number of UTI patients presenting to their doctor, the emergency department, the number hospitalised and the proportion requiring intensive care, as well as local antibiotic resistance trend data.\nISLHD infectious diseases staff specialist Dr Simeon Crawford said the potential costs to the economy and our way of life were extraordinary.\n“We can see the alarming multi-billion-dollar impact of antibiotic resistance across the entire health system nationally,” Dr Crawford said.\n“As more and more germs acquire drug-resistance mechanisms, the burden will rise inexorably. We can’t afford to be complacent.”\nDr Crawford said a greater variety and volume of information was needed to fight the growing resistance of UTIs to antibiotics.\n“Connecting data from different sources will help us to predict and manage the problem,” he said.\n“With the right information we can use antibiotics in a more targeted way; saving lives, saving money and protecting the effectiveness of these invaluable medicines for as long as possible.”\nDistinguished Professor Antoine van Oijen from the University of Wollongong said the proliferation of drug-resistant bacteria was a slow-moving but serious threat.\n“COVID-19 is a very powerful example of how one untreatable virus can bring economies to their knees,” Professor van Oijen said.\n“But drug-resistant bacteria are a bigger, more pervasive problem in health settings and throughout the community.”\nBritish economist Lord Jim O’Neill, who led a landmark review into antibiotic resistance, said the OUTBREAK report was an excellent example of what could be done to determine the costs and consequences of UTIs.\n“I love that the role of diagnostics is at the centre of their recommended approach to dealing with the UTI challenge, which I have long since argued is quite possibly the single most important way of reducing the inappropriate demand for antibiotics,” Lord O'Neill said.\nAdjunct Professor Anna George, a former Australian ambassador and multilateral negotiator, said COVID-19 had shown how a public health threat could undermine entire economies.\n“Consumer behaviour is unpredictable when public health is under threat and that disruption flows through to every business — from multinationals to solo operators,” she said.\nAdjunct Professor George said the economic and health consequences of drug-resistant bacteria spreading through the food chain was an emerging challenge, including for Australian food producers and exporters and an issue currently being negotiated in the international food standard-setting agency, Codex.\n“In the case of UTIs, the bacteria may have a foodborne origin that includes meat and fresh produce,” she said.\nRead the full report here .\nImage credit: ©stock.adobe.com/au/Photographee.eu",

        "We all have experienced muscle pain at one time or another in our life. Scientifically, this term is known as myalgia. It is very common to experience this while doing daily routine activities. Sometimes, we do over-exercise and suffer from sore muscles the next morning; sometimes we lift heavy boxes in the wrong way and get our muscles twisted; often we experience whole body ache when we suffer from flu or viral infection. All these are common forms of muscle pain that everyone goes through quite often. Normally, muscle pain gets relieved if proper rest is given to the body for a couple of days, however, sometimes it becomes more acute and needs medical attention to avoid any further damage and severe pain. This is where proper muscle pain treatment is needed. Causes of Muscle Pain:\nMostly, muscle pain is minor and temporary. It is likely to remain for a few days and then goes away on its own. However, in some cases, it might last longer and needs medical attention. Here are a few causes that can cause this problem, so that you can plan the right muscle pain treatment procedure accordingly. Stress and tension cause muscles in the specific area to get stiff, causing pain in that area. For instance, if you are stressed out, then muscles in your neck region will become tight and stiff and cause pain. It may result from overuse of muscles. Sometimes people tend to overuse a set of muscles either by doing a repetitive activity or intense activity. For instance, you might experience sore shoulders if you do intense backyard or lawn work. Muscle pain also happens due to minor internal injuries. For instance, if you lift up heavy boxes in a careless manner, then it might injure your internal muscle tissues, causing you to experience muscle cramps or spasms. One common cause of experiencing muscle pain is improper posture while doing exercise at the gym. Sometimes, in excitement, people tend to lift heavy weights or overdo crunches or pushups, as a result of which they end up experiencing muscle pain for the next so many days. Other serious causes of muscle pain is: If you have any illness or infection such as flu or Lyme disease. If you suffer from chronic medical a condition such as fibromyalgia, myositis, and lupus. If you are on certain medications such as statins or ACE inhibitors, of which muscle pain is a common side effect. If you suffer from hypo or hyperthyroidism or if you have low potassium in the body Muscle Pain Treatment:\nMuscle pain treatment depends upon the type and cause of muscle pain one is suffering from. If it is less acute and often resulting from stress, tension or improper physical activity, then it will go away by doing certain remedies at home only. However, if it is more acute and severe related to chronic medical conditions, then you need to see a doctor at the earliest. Here are a few tips you must try at first. Give rest to the affected muscle pain area. Apply ice pack on the affected area for 20 minutes a few times a day for 2-3 days. If required, use a heating pad after this. Wrap an elastic bandage around the area to compress it in order to cut swelling and pain. While lying down, keep the affected area raised above your heart level that helps to cut swelling. Take over-the-counter medications to relieve pain, such as ibuprofen. Do yoga and meditation to ease out tension and stress from your body. Gently stretch your muscles to relax them. Keep yourself hydrated to avoid muscle cramps.\nHere are certain signs and symptoms that require specialized muscle pain treatment, such as: If the pain doesn’t go away even after doing home remedies for a few days. If severe pain arises without any clear reason. If you experience muscle pain with a rash or after a tick bite. If you experience redness and swelling along with muscle pain. If you face muscle pain after certain medications. If you experience pain at a higher temperatures. If you are unable to move the affected area\nAll these symptoms are not minor, hence require proper muscle pain treatment from a qualified medical practitioner at the earliest. There are certain specialists who treat muscle pain depending upon its cause: Orthopedic specialists treat pain arising from musculoskeletal conditions. Rheumatologists treat pain caused due to autoimmune or other systemic disorders. Physiotherapists help to manage the pain by exercise and therapeutic techniques. Physiatrists who are well known as rehabilitation doctors, who help you recover after a surgery or accident\nYour body gives you signals whenever it is not in a healthy state. So, pay attention to it and try doing home remedies for a few days. But if the pain still persists, then fix an appointment with a specialist for proper muscle pain treatment .

        'By Karishma Sarkari | 41 minutes ago\nJacinda Ardern has shared a sweet post, reflecting on her "first overseas trip" as a 12-year-old, which happened to be to Australia.\nThe now-Prime Minister of New Zealand shared a photo on Instagram of a souvenir she still has that was bought at Movie World during the family vacation to Queensland.\n"Finishing up some papers with a cup of tea tonight when I couldn\'t help but dwell for a minute over the mug that Clarke made it in," the now 40-year-old told fans. Jacinda Ardern has shared a sweet post, reflecting on her "first overseas trip" as a 12-year-old, which happened to be to Australia (Instagram/JacindaArdern)\n"When I was about 12, my family went to Australia for our first overseas trip together. It was my first time on a plane, and I remember being so excited. I spent months making Dad explain to me every element of a plane ride, including the airport."\nThe PM revealed her parents had "saved hard" to pay for the trip to the Sunshine State, where they stayed with family in Brisbane.\nThe family took Ms Ardern\'s grandad along on the trip, which was shortly after her nana passed away.\n"He very rarely left Te Aroha, he never, ever wore shorts even in the summer, so I remember being really surprised but really happy he came," Ms Ardern said.',

        "0 Comments Things You Need to Do Before a Road Trip\nAre you planning a road trip anytime soon? If you are, let us tell you that road trips are one of the best travelling experiences – all the scenic views, unplanned stops, an ultimate adventure! You won’t regret going on a road trip!\nHowever, before going on a road trip there are some things you need to do first. If you are wondering what those things are, take a look at our list of things to do before a road trip! Things you need to do before a road trip. Have some sort of plan\nGoing on a road trip means not having a certain destination and having the freedom to stop and explore whatever and whenever you want – because it’s about the journey, not the destination! However, having some sort of plan is a must.\nYou should know where you’re headed and if there is a road good enough for a vehicle to pass on it. You should also know whether or not there are gas stations near in case you need gas. You also need to know if where you’re going there will be network coverage, in case of unpredictable situations.\nWhile road trips are fun and all about the adventure, we also need to be cautious and be aware of all the dangers and unpredictable situations. Check and prepare your vehicle\nThis step while preparing for a road trip is crucial. One of the biggest reasons why road trips end abruptly is vehicle problems.\nIn case you’re travelling in your car, make sure everything is working properly and that your car is ready for a trip. You can do this on your own or you can take the car to the mechanic.\nYou should check your tires, all the car lights, and signals, check the battery, and if needed change oil and other fluids. Additionally, make sure you have all the necessary emergency equipment in your car and at least one spare tire.\nIf all this seems complicated or in case you’ve discovered a problem with your car, take it to the mechanic. Experienced mechanics, like those at Carconex , will know how to repair your car or how to service it correctly. This way you’ll be sure that your car has been checked by a professional and that you can safely drive it. Keep an emergency budget\nEven if you’re travelling on a budget , having an additional emergency budget is always a good idea – even more so if you’re planning a road trip. You never know where and when things may go wrong.\nAnd we’re talking about road trips – many unexpected things can happen on road trips. From your vehicle breaking down to unpredictable weather, unplanned lodging, and many other issues.\nSo, even if you’re on a tight budget you should have some cash on hand. Travel documents\nJust like having all the emergency budget and equipment is a must when going on a road trip, so is having all the necessary travel documents . This is especially important if you’re going to be crossing international borders – then a passport is a must, of course, apart from a driver’s license, car insurance and registration, and so on.\nIf you won’t be crossing your countries borders, then you don’t need a passport, but everything else is still a must.\nMake sure you follow all traffic regulations and avoid getting fined for unnecessary traffic violations – yes, you may have an emergency budget, but why waste it? Bring everything you may need\nSince road trips are all about unpredictability and adventure, it’s important to bring all the things that you may need. These things usually include a tent, sleeping bags, portable gas stove, toilet paper, flashlight, and so on. Don’t forget to bring the first aid kit and medication as well!\nOf course, if you’re going on a road trip, you must stock up on food and drinks. Snacks are also very handy, especially if you have kids.\nEnough clothes and shoes – you never know when you may need a change of clothes.\nAnd if you think of anything else that we didn’t mention, don’t forget to bring that with you, too! Don’t forget the entertainment\nIt’s a road trip, so you’re going to be spending a lot of time in a car or other type of vehicle – because of this, you’ll need some sort of entertainment especially if you’re travelling with kids.\nKids get antsy and they don’t have a lot of patience so you’ll need to find a way to keep them entertained. You can mount tablets for them or you can play different kinds of car games such as memory games, number plate bingo, spot or count the animals, and so on.\nIf you’re travelling with adults, you won’t have much trouble. Chatting or listening to the music is enough to pass the time. But you can make a road trip playlist !\nRoad trips can be fun and adventurous but only if we are being cautious and responsible. Never drive off on a road trip without checking your vehicle first, don’t forget to bring all the necessary documents, and always have an emergency budget!\nIf you prepare for a road trip correctly, you can rest assured that you’ll have an amazing traveling experience!",

        "Everyone loves a statement clothing set. Whether it’s a funky coordinated set, a cute t-shirt with some flowy pants or some loose-fitting overalls with a sweet top, this style is always in fashion. Not only does the right set look incredibly chic, it’s also a super easy way to put the perfect outfit together. When it comes to clothes shopping for your baby girl , a clothing set is always a good choice because it looks great, it’s easy to style and it’s also bound to be comfortable for your little one. So, how can you make sure you’re picking the perfect set of summer clothes for your baby girl? Take a look below to find out.\nChoose fabrics that will help her stay cool\nWhen it comes to dressing for summer, one of the most important things to look for is light, breathable fabrics. Shop around for sets that are made from lightweight and natural cotton fibres, as these items are made to be breathable and also easily absorb moisture. By choosing sets that are made from natural fibres, you can help your baby girl regulate her temperature during the warmer months. During this time, it’s also important to avoid fitted pieces and instead opt for flowy, breathable items. This makes sure your little one stays covered to keep her protected in the sun while also staying cool.\nShop with your little girl\nEveryone wants to feel comfortable in their clothing, especially when it comes to the warmer months. From the get go, your baby girl is starting to develop her own personality, taste and style , so it’s always fun to take her on the shopping journey with you to pick out her new outfits. Whether you’re hitting the mall or shopping online, include your little girl in the experience, so she can help you pick out items that she likes. By doing this, you know she will love her new outfit and she will also enjoy being included in picking out her brand-new set. If you let your little girl help you shop, you also know that getting her dressed and ready to go out will also be easier for you, as she will want to put on her new set and be out the door before you know it!\nAccessories are key!\nWe all know that accessories can often make or break an outfit and when it comes to styling your little girl for summer, this is especially important! When summer time comes around, we are especially aware of incorporating sun-safe items into our wardrobes – think statement sunglasses, funky hats and cool cover ups. When you’re shopping around for a set for your baby girl, consider what accessories she already has, or accessories you would like her to have, before you make your choice. By planning a summer capsule wardrobe, you know that all of her outfits will go together and also pair up perfectly with her sunhat, sunglasses and other cute accessories!

Anyone who falls in either category should be tested for COVID-19, and will be required to isolate.\nThe highest risk settings are updated regularly on the SA website.\nPeople of all ages have been diagnosed with COVID-19, but those most at risk of severe illness are elderly people and those with pre-existing medical conditions. Symptoms and transmission\nReported symptoms include fever or respiratory symptoms such as cough, sore throat and shortness of breath runny nose, anosmia or loss or change in smell or taste. Recent information on the transmission of the virus suggests that cases may be infectious up to 48 hours before the onset of symptoms, until at least 24 hours after symptoms resolve. The World Health Organization has confirmed that the main driver of transmission is from symptomatic patients through coughing and sneezing. Transmission by people without symptoms is also possible. Some evidence indicates transmission can occur through aerosol transmission. Who should be tested?

        'Inside tips from one of The Block\'s judges.\nPrepare to go big this Christmas, says interior designer and The Block judge Darren Palmer. After all, we have a year\'s worth of celebrating with family and friends to catch up on. According to Palmer, there are four key decorating trends to look for this holiday season:\nLuxe\nThink a palette of pink, champagne and gold, complemented by a little sparkle. "This is a really sparkly, glamorous, elevated luxe look."\nGet the look with: Luxe at Myer Silver Prancing Reindeer with Jewelled Antlers Australian Christmas\nCelebrate all that\'s unique about Christmas at home with a moodboard inspired by the bush or the beach. Look for natural colours and textures and natives like gumnuts and eucalyptus.\nGet the look with: Australian House & Garden at Myer Faux Protea & Native Foliage Wreath Traditional heirloom\nEmbrace all the trimmings but keep it classic with a mix of red, green and white or silver. Get the look with: Heirloom at Myer Red Santa Countdown to Christmas Merry & Bright\n"If you want to go all out, now is the time. Put up the Santa, have all the flashing lights, and a big tree covered in every Christmas decoration you can find." Why not top off this more-is-more aesthetic with a neon sign or animated tree-topper?\nGet the look with: Mr Christmas Flying Santa Animated Tree Topper Mix and match\nThink of these trends as a guideline and cherry-pick the elements that work with your own style. Palmer likes to mix the "luxe" and "Australian Christmas" themes, adding in key elements from his own interiors range to get the look.\n"Take some elements from the Australian native theme, such as woven placemats or a grey or camel-coloured linen tablecloth – things that have a handmade feeling. Then add a little bit of gold and a little bit of brass. A woven rattan material plays really beautifully with brass, and those two things play beautifully against eucalyptus. They\'re a match made in heaven.\n"For example, I\'d use the candlestick holders from my range, they\'re brass and they have a ceramic earthenware base. They make a perfect table centerpiece. Then I\'d add big chunks of resin coral ." Layer the table as you would a room\nCreating a beautiful Christmas tablescape is all about using a mix of textures and heights, says Palmer. "You have to look at creating interest, in terms of where your eye falls and how your eye is led through something."\nStart with the base layer: a tablecloth, runner or placemats , or a combination of the three. Next, add in the cutlery, crockery and servingware. Then bring in some height with candlesticks or flowers. Finally, don\'t forget the details to really elevate your Christmas table.\n"You want to go all out and have napkin rings , bon-bons or crackers and beautiful candelabras," says Palmer. "Adding some Australian native foliage looks really gorgeous – whether it\'s in a napkin holder with your napkin, or it\'s part of a cascading arrangement across a table." Don\'t forget the outdoors\nFrom suburban backyards to inner-city patios, outdoor spaces will be an important entertaining area this year so be sure to give yours some attention by extending your decorating theme to undercover areas outside.\n"So much can be achieved with fairy lights or festoon lighting," Palmer notes. "Once the sun goes down, it will be appreciated that you went to that little bit of extra effort."\nAfter all the missed events this year, there\'s only one place to make up for it. Myer has endless gift ideas all in one place to make your celebrations bigger than Christmas. Style',

        "COVID-19 vaccine provisional determinations 18 November 2020\nThe Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), part of the Department of Health, has granted a number of provisional determinations in relation to COVID-19 vaccines.\nThe granting of a provisional determination means that the TGA has made a decision that relevant sponsors are now eligible to apply for provisional registration for the vaccine in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG).\nProvisional determination is the first step in the process and does not mean that an application has or will be made, or that the vaccine will be provisionally approved for inclusion in the ARTG. Provisional determinations are effective for 6 months.\nNormally for a vaccine to be registered in Australia, a sponsor (usually a pharmaceutical company) is required to submit a complete and comprehensive package of data to the TGA. A formal evaluation is then carried out in multiple stages by technical experts, prior to a decision being made.\nThe provisional pathway provides a formal and transparent mechanism for speeding up the registration of promising new medicines with preliminary clinical data. In order to apply for provisional registration, the sponsor must first apply for a provisional determination. Further information on eligibility criteria can be found at: Provisional determination: A step-by-step guide for prescription medicines .\nIn making its decision to grant these provisional determinations, the TGA considered all eligibility criteria, including factors such as the evidence of a plan to submit comprehensive clinical data and the seriousness of the current COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn addition to these determination, the TGA is actively monitoring COVID-19 vaccine development that is occurring both in Australia and around the world, and is part of a network of international regulators that meet regularly to discuss the development of COVID-19 vaccines and the establishment of systems for monitoring the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 vaccines once they have reached the market. The ability to access early data and planned collaboration with international regulators will assist the TGA to expedite the evaluation of any new vaccines without compromising on our strict requirements for safety, quality and effectiveness of products.

        'South Australia is going into a six-day lockdown as a "circuit-breaker" to help get on top of a COVID-19 outbreak in Adelaide. South Australia will go into lockdown for six days, with a range of restrictions to provide a "circuit-breaker" and help control a worrying cluster of COVID-19 cases in Adelaide. Imposing some of Australia\'s swiftest and strictest measures during the global pandemic, Premier Steven Marshall says pausing most community activity will significantly reduce the risk of the virus spreading further. It could also prevent the need for a much longer Victorian-style shutdown."We need this circuit breaker, this community pause. We are at a critical point, but we will get through this," the premier said on Wednesday. "We are really asking the people of South Australia to join with us on this mighty quest to stop this disease in its tracks."We\'ve got one chance with this." Police Commissioner Grant Stevens said the six-day period would be followed by another eight days of continuing restrictions. From midnight all schools will close along with universities, pubs, cafes, food courts and takeaway food outlets. Regional travel will be banned and aged care centres will go into lockdown. Factories will close, along with the construction industry, and elective surgery will cease. Wedding and funerals will be banned along with all outdoor sport and exercise and masks will be required outside the home. People will only be allowed to leave their homes once each day to buy groceries or to seek a COVID-19 test or other medical treatment. Supermarkets, petrol stations, medical centres, critical infrastructure, public transport, airport and freight services, banks, post offices, school and childcare for essential workers and veterinary services will be allowed. The business sector has backed the lockdown but said it could be devastating for the state economy. Chief Public Health Officer Nicola Spurrier said the so-called Parafield cluster had only grown by two cases to 22 overnight. Seven more people, thought likely to be infected, are waiting on test results. However, she said there were worrying signs about the spread of the virus through the community, with information suggesting the particular strain had a short incubation period."Clearly, if it\'s reintroduced to the community it takes off very quickly," Prof Spurrier said."That\'s exactly what happened in Victoria. I don\'t want that to happen in South Australia and I\'m going to do everything possible to make sure that doesn\'t happen."I would really like to not have any further cases here, but I think it\'s inevitable that we will."But I want all of those chains of transmission to stop." With immediate signs of panic-buying across Adelaide\'s supermarkets, Mr Stevens urged people to stay calm and be assured that supplies of all necessary items would be maintained. But he said police could only do so much to enforce the lockdown and its restrictions."Our expectation is people will do the right thing and will abide by this extreme level of imposition for a short period of time and help us do our job," he said."Clearly, if you are out and about during these six days you should have the ability to justify the reason for your travel."But essentially, you are required to stay at home for the next six days." Thousands of people continued to flock to testing stations on Wednesday after 5000 tests were conducted on Monday and more than 6000 on Tuesday. Efforts were being made to extend the hours of operation by bringing in more staff, including some from interstate. A number of sites across Adelaide are of key concern, particularly a pizza bar, where a worker tested positive, two northern suburbs schools, a hospital and a swimming centre. People who visited those sites have been asked to quarantine and get tested. Almost 40 other locations are listed as places confirmed cases have visited in recent days, with people there at the same time asked to monitor for symptoms and get tested if they feel ill.

        "Recognising when the health of an aged care resident is deteriorating is fundamental to ensuring the person receives the care and treatment they need.\nIt’s a sign that intervention is needed. When deterioration occurs it’s important it’s recognised promptly, and that appropriate action is taken.\nBut how can aged care workers observe the often subtle signs that a person is deteriorating, especially if they are agency staff and seeing different people every day, or if they are new to an aged care home?\nA member of HelloCare’s Aged Care Worker Support Group recently asked if there is a structured way to identify if a resident is deteriorating. We reached out to an expert in the field to find out what tools they recommend, what to look out for, and what carers can do when they find that a person in their care has begun to decline. A sudden change in habits\nKate Reed is a palliative care nurse practitioner and works with Palliative Care Australia. She has worked in aged care homes for over a decade. When we spoke earlier this week, she began by telling HelloCare that the first thing you will notice when a person is deteriorating is a change in their habits.\n“You might think, ‘Mum’s been in bed for two days. She might have a bad day every now and again, but two days is a bit strange, and she didn’t eat her dinner last night and she didn’t want her breakfast.’\n“These sorts of changes can be really telling that something is going on,” Ms Reed explained.\nEarly signs of deterioration to look out for include a sudden lack of care about appearance, stopping attending group activities, and reminiscing about the past.\nMore than two trips to hospital within a six-month period can also be an early sign of deterioration, Ms Reed said. Fatigue and a loss of interest in food\nIn the later stages of deterioration, people might experience more fatigue than usual and they might begin to lose interest in food.\n“It’s really important to keep their mouth clean and moist, but they’re unlikely to be wanting to have food” when their condition has progressed to this stage, Ms Reed said.\nThey might have nausea or a change in their bowel movements too.\nPeople with a malignant disease may notice an increase in symptoms, for example, there might be an increase in pain or an increase in fluid in their bodies causing swollen feet because their heart isn’t working so effectively.\nSome people go from being in “lots of pain to being in very little pain,” Ms Reed said.\nIt’s probably not surprising that distress can also be a common factor at this stage.\n“The level of distress a person is having with their symptoms speaks to us about how fast you need to move,” Ms Reed said. “If they do have distress, it’s really important to involve specialist palliative care at that point.” Assessment tools\nMembers of the Support Group said the ‘Stop and watch early warning tool’ provides a framework for monitoring changes in a resident.\nIt prompts staff to be alert for potential changes in condition and provides a simple, clear way to communicate changes to nurses. Source: med-pass.com\nMs Reed recommends the ‘Supportive and Palliative Care Indicators Tool’ – also known as SPICT – for regular assessments. These checks can be “repeatable and regular” so you can check a person over time and see how they have deteriorated.\nCarers can use the tool to assess if the resident has unmet support and palliative care needs, and it can trigger important conversations and reviews to help plan future care.\nMs Reed also said asking the ‘surprise question’ – asking if you would be surprised if the person was to die in the next 12 months – can also be helpful.\nIf the answer is yes, then little needs to be done immediately other than some advance care planning.\nBut if the answer is no, Ms Reed recommends making sure the advance care plan is up to date. Begin having ‘goals of care’ conversations with the health team and loved ones about what the person wants, such as where they want to be to die and what interventions they would like. When death is near communication is key\nIn the sad situation where it appears the person is likely to die soon, Mr Reed says it’s important to contact their GP.\n“The GP is the primary care provider and they will often have a really good idea of where the patient’s at,” she said.\nA case conference with the GP and specialists can determine what the person’s prognosis is, what to expect in terms of symptoms, and what can be done to support the person. It’s about making sure the person is not going to suffer, so that everyone is informed, and so that loved ones all have the same picture and there is therefore consistency in the plan.\n“You can have a really great plan, but if it’s not communicated to everyone then it can fall apart because there’s a lot of emotion and stress at that time,” Ms Reed said. Deterioration in the final days\n‘Terminal care planning’ is done in the last days to week, Ms Reed recommended, and involves talking to families about what to expect.\nAt this stage of life, the person’s consciousness will decline, and they’re unlikely to be able to swallow. They may experience confusion and disorientation. Alternative measures have to be taken, such as using injections and infusions, to make sure they receive the medication they need “so they’re not suffering”, Mr Reed said.\nIt’s important that family are informed about what dying will look like, and that the deterioration and changes they are seeing are a normal part of the dying process.\nMany people die without palliative care, but at this stage of life people still need to be assessed regularly to identify what symptoms they are experiencing, and to make sure symptoms are being addressed properly.\nPlans need to be in place by this stage. For example, it’s important to know what to do if the resident doesn’t want to go to hospital. Who’s the first person staff should call if something goes wrong? Who’s the enduring power of attorney?\n“Those sorts of plans need to be in place way before they’re needed,” Ms Reed recommends. An inexact science\nRecognising the signs of deterioration as a person’s disease progresses does become easier and more acute with experience, Ms Reed said.\n“I’ve looked after so many people who have been dying and have died, and also people who have been living with their disease for quite a long time. Treatments are better and people are living longer… but it still isn’t an exact science,” she said.\n(Visited 2 times, 9 Caroline Egan\nCaroline Egan has been a writer and editor for more than 20 years, and has worked across several sectors, including banking, finance, economics, real estate, and aged care.

        "The South Australian opposition has called for more testing resources in Adelaide to help combat a COVID-19 outbreak. Testing stations should remain open around the clock and more should be opened in Adelaide's north to handle a surge in demand because a growing COVID-19 cluster, the South Australian opposition says. Labor has also called on SA Health to create a dedicated clinic for people urgently being asked to get tested because they may have links to the Parafield outbreak.\"It has been outstanding to see so many South Australians do the right thing and seek to get a COVID-19 test,\" Opposition Leader Peter Malinauskas said on Wednesday. \"But it has been disturbing to see people, many of them unwell, forced to wait for more than 10 hours, with many turned away.\"It's understandable there would be long queues in the immediate hours following news of this cluster, but it's now been three days.\" Mr Malinauskas said the urgency of the situation was even greater with Adelaide forecast to have a top temperature of 34C on Wednesday, meaning many people will spend hours in the heat waiting for a test. About 5000 people were tested on Monday and more than 6000 on Tuesday with some people forced to wait in line for up to 12 hours and others turned away when centres closed. So far there's been 20 confirmed coronavirus cases linked to the Parafield cluster but that number is expected to grow. It was sparked when a cleaner in one of Adelaide's quarantine hotels was infected and passed it on to her family members. In a social media post on Wednesday, SA Health urged people getting tested to be patient and to expect delays. It said people attending at walk-in sites should bring water, snacks, sun protection and a chair. Chief Public Health Officer Nicola Spurrier said officials were aware of the long delays and were working to increase staffing and resources. Related Articles",

        "TGA grants third provisional determination for a COVID-19 vaccine 18 November 2020\nOn 16 November 2020 the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), part of the Department of Health, granted a provisional determination to Janssen Cilag Pty Ltd (Janssen) in relation to its COVID-19 vaccine, Ad26.COV2.S.\nThe granting of a provisional determination means that the TGA has made a decision that Janssen is now eligible to apply for provisional registration for the vaccine in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG).\nProvisional determination is the first step in the process and does not mean that an application has or will be made, or that the vaccine will be provisionally approved for inclusion in the ARTG.\nThe provisional pathway provides a formal and transparent mechanism for speeding up the registration of promising new medicines with preliminary clinical data. In order to apply for provisional registration, the sponsor must first apply for a provisional determination. Further information on eligibility criteria can be found found at: Provisional determination: A step-by-step guide for prescription medicines .\nIn making its decision to grant Janssen a provisional determination, the TGA considered all eligibility criteria, including factors such as the evidence of a plan to submit comprehensive clinical data and the seriousness of the current COVID-19 pandemic.

        "Last year, 90 year old John Steele took part in the annual More the Merrier campaign. That Christmas brunch marked the first in 30 years he’d spent with others. The ‘Christmas Brunch with a Difference’ was a gift like no other after spending so many Christmases alone.\n“That Christmas [last year] meant a lot to me because it was the first Christmas dinner I’d had in 30 years with people around me. It made me feel good,” said John.\n“Connection and friendship are the greatest gifts you can have.”\nOn December 25th, participants will gather around their tables, linking up via laptops, smart tablets and phones, through Feros Care’s Virtual Social Centre digital platform, and will share in Christmas Hampers, which will be delivered in advance by the not-for-profit.\nThe group of 100 will be broken up into smaller, more intimate “tables” as guests enjoy a two hour brunch together, with volunteers giving up their own Christmas Day to keep the conversation rolling across the e-tables.\nThe hampers, which will be opened together and shared on the day include festive treats like delicious food and drinks, a bon bon for cracking, a CD full of festive favourite songs and carols, and each participant will also receive a special Christmas gift.\n“We see loneliness every day in our work, but Christmas is known to be the loneliest time of all, especially for our treasured seniors and more than ever this year, when so many loved ones have been divided across international and state borders,” said Jo Winwood, head of Be Someone For Someone.\n“More than a quarter of Australians experience loneliness and we have met seniors who worried that they would never hear their name spoken again or that their voice might not work, it had been so long since they had spoken to someone.\n“Be Someone For Someone is committed to helping people enjoy the social connections critical for humans to survive. Christmas is such a difficult time so we’re spreading the message that the more connected we are, the merrier we will be,” Jo said.\n“No one should be alone at Christmas and the team at Be Someone For Someone is doing what they can to break the cycle of isolation that impacts so many people,” said Feros Care CEO Jennene Buckley.\nIf you’d like to get involved with this incredible cause, you can donate $50 to ensure a lonely older person will wake up on Christmas Day to a hamper under their tree, and for $100 you can gift them a seat at the brunch. You can also contribute to the hampers, or share your own stories about the importance of online connection. More importantly, you can inspire others to get involved.\nThis year, you also have the chance to win a pair of iPads to help foster even greater connections between you and a friend. By sharing your heartwarming plans for this year’s online connections and festivities, you go into the running to win, thanks to Be Someone For Someone and their community efforts to raise awareness of the need to reach out to others at Christmas.\nFor more information and to get involved, visit www.besomeoneforsomeone.org/morethemerrier (Visited 1 times, 1 Rianna Manuel\nRianna is a journalist and content creator with writing experience in current affairs, culture and events.

        "Posted by Lydia Hales\nTaking three or more anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) was associated with a two-thirds reduction in risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) compared to patients taking no AEDs, in what the authors say is the largest study of its kind.\nTo investigate the association between drug exposure and sudden death risk, Karolinska University Hospital researchers conducted a case-control study using the Swedish national database of prescribed drug dispensing at Swedish pharmacies, medical records of all patients with epilepsy hospitalised or managed in hospital-based ambulatory care during 1998–2005, and the national cause of death registry.\nMedications analysed included AEDs, SSRIs and other antidepressants, neuroleptics, and beta-blockers.\nThe analysis of 255 sudden death cases and 1,148 matched control cases revealed that AED polytherapy appeared to be protective, whereas patients who suffered sudden death were 2.75 times more likely to have “nonadherence” mentioned in their medical record.\n“Polytherapy, especially taking three or more AEDs, was associated with a substantially reduced risk of SUDEP (OR 0.31),” the authors wrote in Neurology. Related Drugs Caution urged over cannabis for paediatric epilepsy\n“AED polytherapy in general and more specifically in combinations including lamotrigine, valproic acid, and levetiracetam was associated with significantly reduced risks.”\nAmong patients prescribed only one AED, they found levetiracetam was associated with the lowest sudden death risk (OR 0.10). The authors said the finding as interesting but noted these case numbers were small.\n“The results of the less frequently used AEDs in this study, levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, and topiramate, need to be interpreted cautiously given the smaller numbers and the corresponding wider confidence intervals,” they said.\n“To our knowledge, this [levetiracetam] finding has not been reported before. Levetiracetam has a mode of action different from other AEDs. Whether this relates to a possible effect on SUDEP risk remains to be explored.”\nNone of the specific AEDs was associated with an increased risk of sudden death when adjustments were made to allow for potential confounders including the frequency of generalised tonic-clonic seizures (which involve loss of consciousness, and both stiffening and twitching or jerking phases of muscle activity).\nStatins were the only non-AED drug class associated with a reduced risk: after adjusting for generalised tonic-clonic seizure frequency, this medication was linked to a 66% reduced risk.\nThis was the first study to indicate a reduction in mortality associated with statins, which might be “a suitable candidate for future research to identify SUDEP preventive interventions,” the authors said.\nThe potential protective effect of AED polytherapy suggested by their results was in contrast with two previous studies that found an increased mortality associated with polytherapy compared to monotherapy. But the authors noted that increased risk with polytherapy disappeared when the other studies accounted for the frequency of generalised tonic-clonic seizures.\n“Given the conflicting results with some previous reports, our data on polytherapy should be interpreted cautiously, although adding an AED to existing baseline AED treatment of patients with refractory seizures has been associated with a reduced SUDEP risk in the context of randomised controlled trials,” they said.\n“Our data furthermore indicate that AEDs may lower the risk of SUDEP not just by reducing the frequency of GTCS [generalised tonic-clonic seizures] and that treatment with statins may be protective. Efforts should be made to enhance medication adherence as this is likely to reduce SUDEP risk.”",

        "Tweet +\nA new paper in JNCI: Journal of the National Cancer Institute indicates that receiving assisted reproductive technology does not increase the risk women have for developing ovarian cancer.\nPrevious research indicated that women who use assisted reproductive technology in order to have a successful pregnancy could potentially be at risk for ovarian cancer and non-malignant borderline ovarian tumours due to excess stimulation of the ovaries.\nSince the introduction of assisted reproductive technology –including in vitro fertilisation, intracytoplasmic sperm injection and cryopreservation of embryos –four decades ago, some researchers have raised concerns that such technology might increase the risk of ovarian tumours.\nResearchers have proposed that this could potentially be due to large increases of sex hormone levels and multiple punctures disrupting ovarian tissue.\nBecause of the worldwide increase in the use of fertility treatments and the poor prognosis of ovarian cancer, it is important to examine the association between fertility treatments and long-term risk of ovarian tumours.\nSeveral epidemiological studies have investigated the association between such treatments and risk of ovarian tumours, with inconsistent results.\nIn 2013, two meta-analyses were published showing that women who received fertility treatments were more likely to develop ovarian cancer compared with the general population.\nBut it remained unclear if fertility treatments caused women to develop ovarian cancer or if the association could be due to other factors, such as infertility itself.\nResearchers here were able to link a database on use of assisted reproductive technology treatment procedures in the Netherlands with national cancer registries to see if an excess risk of ovarian tumours resulted.\nThis nationwide cohort study included 30,625 women who received ovarian stimulation for ART between 1983 and 2001 and 9,988 infertile women who did not receive such treatment.\nIncident invasive and borderline ovarian tumours were ascertained through linkage with the Netherlands Cancer Registry and the Dutch Pathology Registry.\nThe researchers investigated risks of ovarian tumours in infertile women who received ovarian stimulation for assisted reproductive technology compared with the risks in the general population and with infertile women who received no such treatment.\nAfter a median follow-up of 24 years, researchers observed 158 invasive cancers and 100 borderline ovarian tumours.\nNo increased risk of ovarian cancer was found in women who received assisted reproductive technology treatment compared with infertile women who did not receive the treatment.\nEven after more than 20 years the risk of ovarian cancer was not increased.\nCompared with women in the general Dutch population, women who received assisted reproductive technology did have a higher risk of ovarian cancer, but this appeared to be mainly caused by the higher proportion of women who received assisted reproductive technology who remained childless.\nChildlessness has been shown to be a strong risk factor for ovarian cancer. Among for assisted reproductive technology-treated women in the study ovarian cancer risk decreased with a larger number of successful for assisted reproductive technology cycles (resulting in childbirth).\nWomen who received such treatment appear to have an almost two-fold increased risk of borderline ovarian tumours, both when compared with the general population and with infertile women not receiving the treatment.\nHowever, risks of borderline ovarian tumours did not increase after more treatment cycles or after longer follow-up.\nThis suggests that the increased risks observed for borderline ovarian tumours might be due to underlying patient characteristics rather than the treatment itself.\nBorderline tumours are rare in the general population and are generally easy to treat.\n“Reassuringly, women who received ovarian stimulation for assisted reproductive technology do not have an increased risk of malignant ovarian cancer, not even in the long run,” said the study’s lead author, Flora E. van Leeuwen.\n“However, it is important to realise that even with the long follow-up in our study, the median age of the women at end of follow-up was only 56 years.\nAs the incidence of ovarian cancer in the population increases at older ages, it is important to follow assisted reproductive technology-treated women even longer.”",

        "Tweet +\nNew insights into the mechanisms behind how cancer-causing agents in the environment activate genetic recombination in DNA could help to explain some of the effects of exposure as well as predicting which individuals may be more susceptible to developing the disease, a new UK study has suggested.\nThe paper ‘PrimPol-dependent single-stranded gap formation mediates homologous recombination at bulky DNA adducts’ was published in Nature Communications .\nEveryone is exposed to low levels of carcinogens (substances or radiation that promote the formation of cancer) in the environment.\nOne of the most widely found is benzopyrene – a general chemical pollutant found in smoke from stoves such as wood burners, exhaust fumes and barbecued meat and fish.\nOne active ingredient of benzopyrene, BPDE, directly damages the DNA sequence forming what is known as adducts which in turn promote cancer-causing mutations.\nWhile models exist showing how BPDE causes these mutations, some of the pathways are still not understood.\nIt is currently believed that a BPDE adducts cause mutations during DNA synthesis because they activate a process called translesion synthesis – where cells copy the DNA despite the presence of unrepaired damage to allow progression of the replication fork – and this induces mutations.\nHowever, evidence also suggests the involvement of another process called homologous recombination (HR) which works by copying other undamaged parts of the genome.\nHR proteins repair complex DNA damage such as breaks in the DNA strands and interstrand cross-links, and protect and recover stalled or broken replication forks.\nThis latest study treated human cell lines with BPDE before using molecular biology methods, such as microscopy, to characterise the homologous recombination pathway in detail.\nResults have offered new insights showing that HR proceeds by an unusual mechanism at BPDE adducts and the process can be activated even when there are no stalled or collapsed replication forks.\nInstead, it is activated at single-stranded gaps in the DNA that are generated by the re-priming activity of PrimPol – a protein encoded by the PRIMPOL gene in humans.\nThe findings also address longstanding questions by showing that at bulky DNA adducts, the exchanges between the sister chromatids (the identical copies formed by the DNA replication of a chromosome), products of HR that have been traditionally connected with replication fork collapse and DSB repair, are associated with the repair of post-replicative gaps.\nFurthermore, these post-replicative gaps are produced by PrimPol, shedding light on the function of PrimPol during DNA damage tolerance.\nCorresponding author Dr Eva Petermann from the University of Birmingham’s Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, says: “Our study has revealed new insights into the effects of benzopyrene exposure in cells, which is important for understanding environmental causes of cancer and cancer development in general. Understanding this mechanism could help to better predict and detect negative effects of pollution as well as allowing for better interpretation of cancer genomics. For example, genetic variants in the HR genes BRCA2 and RAD52 have been liked to lung cancer susceptibility meaning that understanding how HR helps cell deal with benzopyrene could help us to predict individuals who may be more susceptible to the disease\n“Moving forwards it will be important to investigate the impact of such genetic variants on HR at ssDNA gaps. A PRIMPOL variant has also been suggested to play a potential role in cancer. It could also help predict which individuals will be more sensitive to carcinogen exposure.”",

        "Tweet +\nImmunotherapy is a cancer treatment that helps the patient’s immunological system to combat it and has a hugely positive impact in cancer treatments, even though it does not work in all cases: it is highly successful in some patients whereas in others it has little or no effect.\nGiven the risks inherent in these procedures, a growing need has emerged to specify which patients are more likely to benefit from them, thus avoiding unnecessary exposure of those who will not benefit.\nFellow researchers from other centres in the Basque Country (Biocruces, PIE, BCAM), in Europe and the company FASTBASE Solutions Ltd have participated in the group led by Dr Larijani, who is also the director of the Centre for Therapeutic Innovation of the University of Bath (United Kingdom).\nThe new predictive tool has been developed by using an advanced microscopy platform that identifies the interactions between the immune cells and the tumour cells and also informs about the activation state of the immune checkpoints that buffer the anti-tumour response.\nThe team has published its findings in the prestigious journal Cancer Research.\nDr Larijani’s team has analysed one immune checkpoint.\nIn a healthy individual these checkpoints closely regulate the body’s immune response, acting as a switch to prevent self-immune and inflammatory diseases.\nSpecifically, the immune checkpoint analysed comprises two proteins: PD-1 (present in immune cells known as T-lymphocytes) and PD-L1 (present in other types of immune cells and on the surface of many different types of tumours).\nAs a rule, when PD-1 on the surface of T-lymphocytes joins up with PD-L1 on the surface of other immune cells, it efficiently switches off the immune function of the T cell.\nAnd that is what tumour cells do: when PD-L1 is expressed on their surface, PD-1 is activated in the T-lymphocyte, so their anti-tumour function is deactivated and the tumour is allowed to survive and grow.\nThe inhibitors used in immunotherapy function by interrupting the interaction between PD-L1 on the tumour and PD-1 in the T cell, thus restoring the patient’s anti-tumour activity.\nThis new tool determines the scope of the PD-1 / PD-L1 interaction in a tumour biopsy by predicting whether therapy using checkpoint inhibitors is likely to bring significant clinical benefits.\n“Right now, decisions about whether to proceed with checkpoint inhibitor treatment are simply based on whether PD-1 and PD-L1 are present in the biopsies rather than in their functional state.\nHowever, our work has shown that it is much more important to know that the two proteins actually interact and, therefore, that they are likely to have a functional impact on the survival of the tumour,” said Prof Larijani.",

        "Posted by TMR Staff\nA group of influential and longtime RACGP members have started a campaign to have the chair of the RACGP sacked and the whole board censured for poor performance at the upcoming AGM.\nOn November 10, Associate Professor Chris Hogan and Dr Karyn Matterson published an RACGP member call on a newly established Facebook site titled Members voice at RACGP 2019-20 AGM which outlined their serious concerns with governance, expenditure, the handling of the recent fellowship exams, and the overall competence of the current board.\nThe post explained that an attempt to have a series of associated resolutions put to the AGM was rejected by the executive based on the RACGP constitution (which has a rule requiring 21 days’ notice for resolutions to be added to the AGM agenda) but the leaders of the executive said they were prepared to meet and listen to the concerns in person.\nThe full initial post of Professor Hogan and Dr Matterson is reproduced below.\nProfessor Hogan and Dr Matterson then conducted a 48-hour online poll on the new site and gained 184 votes for their resolutions, both of which received overwhelming numbers in favour (over 97%).\nResolution 1: “That the Board be requested not to reappoint Christine Nixon as Chair of the Board following the AGM.”\nExplanatory Statement\nPursuant to clause 7.5 of the Constitution, the Chair is appointed by the Board (from among the Board members) at the first Board meeting following the Annual General Meeting. As the current Chair Christine Nixon has not yet completed her term on the Board, there is a reasonable prospect that she will be reappointed as Chair following the AGM. The requisitioning members consider that the performance of the 2019/2020 Board is, to a significant extent, the responsibility of the Chair. Although the members do not have the power to direct the Board to refrain from reappointing Ms Nixon, this resolution serves as an expression of the will of the members that the Board is encouraged to take into account.\nResolution 2: “That the members censure the 2019/2020 Board due to their failure to deliver core strategic objectives as outlined in the RACGP Strategic Plan 2018-2022”\nExplanatory statement\nA motion of censure is of no legal effect – it is simply an expression of significant disappointment and concern regarding the Board’s performance.\nProfessor Hogan notes in his explanation to members that while a motion of no confidence has no legal effect, “…by convention, a Board will often resign if more than half of the members vote in favour of a motion of no confidence”.\nThe poll was subsequently closed and yesterday CEO Dr Matthew Miles and Company Secretary David Goldberg met with Professor Hogan and Dr Matterson. Professor Hogan subsequently posted:\n“Our position was the need for the RACGP to take immediate and strong action toward the failings of the Board, specifically the 23 failures itemised on our explanatory notes. We expressed the urgent need for change & constant improvement as a way forward to re-instil confidence and rebuild the much-needed trust of the members.\n“Our next steps are to meet with members of the Board to describe the views of the membership that have been expressed to us by yourselves. We have yet to be given a date for an appropriate forum to do so but hope that this will occur within the next week.”\nDr Miles and Mr Goldberg also issued an official statement referring to the meeting saying:\n“Although we could not accept the motions, we treat the feedback seriously and have offered these members other avenues to engage with the board … We are doing everything in our power to remediate the [exams] situation and support those affected, including refunding fees for the assessments as quickly as possible.\n“While the AGM will be delivered remotely this year, there will still be a question-and-answer session, where members are able to submit questions for the board.”\nThe initial Facebook post by Professor Hogan and Dr Matterson:\nThis is a call to action for members of the RACGP.\nWe are two RACGP members, a GPiT (Dr Karyn Matterson) & a Life Member (A/Professor Chris Hogan).\nLast week we, in a polite & courteous manner, delivered a list of major concerns we had about how the outgoing Board had handled its affairs. We asked that they not confuse our courtesy for temerity.\nWe have concerns about governance, expenditures, the handling of the recent Fellowship exams & our perception that the Board was out of touch and/or the Senior Leadership was ineffectual at delivering the memberships will. We asked that our concerns be taken to the 2020 AGM so that they could explain their actions to the members & be judged by them.\nWhile polite in their response, they refused our request to do so. They relied on legal principles instead of our democratic right and our insistence for ethical and moral accountability.\nHowever there were two very important issues that were raised in that response.\nThe first was extremely telling.\nNow, we two are members of RACGP & both subscribe to the critical principle that the College is its members. The College is not its officials, not its representatives but is all of us.\nThe letter from the same Board we were worried about being out of touch said against us, that “In summary, the RACGP’s view is that……..”\nWell guess what? We are the College too! They are the outgoing Board theoretically elected to serve the members not to oppose them; to listen to members, not to silence them.\nThis attitude exemplifies our concerns even if it might have been a Freudian slip .\nThe second issue was an indirect exploration of how many members share our concerns about the outgoing Board’s actions?\nSo we have a question of you.\nHow many members are of the opinion we should be able to take our concerns to be discussed & to be voted on at the AGM?\nThat is concerns about the outgoing Board’s governance, expenditures, the handling of the recent Fellowship exams & our perception that the Board was out of touch.\nOur request is deliberately vague. We say again, our request is deliberately vague. We wish to improve the RACGP to let the members voices be heard and not to cause scandal. Who will collectively stand with us to respectfully challenge the Board decision not to allow our motions to be added into the Agenda ? We need many members voices to be heard as we can gather. in this story: RACGP",

        "Tweet +\nWhen a patient with cancer is told the devastating news that their disease has spread, or metastasised, to a new part of their body, it has most often moved to their lungs.\nThe branching blood vessels that allow oxygen to diffuse from the lungs’ air sacs into red blood cells are so tiny that a rogue cancer cell circulating in the bloodstream can easily get stuck there and take up residence, eventually growing into a secondary tumour.\nOnce established, metastatic tumours unleash a campaign of chemical cues that thwart the body’s defenses, hampering efforts to induce an immune response.\nThere are no treatments approved for lung metastasis, which is the leading cause of death from metastatic disease.\nThat grim prognosis may soon be less grim thanks to a new technique developed by researchers at Harvard’s Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering and John A. Paulson School for Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS), USA.\nRather than viewing lung metastasis as unfortunate fallout from a primary tumour elsewhere, the team focused on treating the metastasis itself by delivering immune-cell-attracting chemicals into lung cancers via red blood cells.\nNot only did this approach halt lung tumour growth in mice with metastatic breast cancer, it also acted as a vaccine and protected the animals against future cancer recurrences.\nThe research is reported in Nature Biomedical Engineering .\n“Our approach is the exact opposite of conventional cancer treatments that focus on getting the immune system to recognise and attack the primary tumour, because those tumours are often large and difficult for immune cells to penetrate,” said co-first author Zongmin Zhao, Ph.D., a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Wyss Institute and SEAS.\n“We recognised that the high density of blood vessels in the lungs provides much better access to tumours there, offering a unique opportunity to induce an immune response by targeting the metastasis.”\nAn EASI solution to a hard problem\nDelivering therapies to their intended target while sparing the rest of the body is one of the grand challenges of medicine.\nThe liver and spleen are incredibly efficient at filtering out any foreign substances from the blood, meaning that drugs often need to be given at a high dose that can cause harmful off-target side effects.\nOvercoming this barrier to effective treatment is a major focus of Wyss Core Faculty member Samir Mitragotri’s work, and his lab recently discovered that attaching drug-filled nanoparticles to red blood cells allows them to escape detection and stay in the body long enough to deliver their payloads while minimising toxicity.\nZhao and his co-authors decided to use that technique to see if they could deliver immune-system-stimulating chemicals to metastatic lung tumours rather than chemotherapy, which can damage lung tissue.\nThey chose a chemokine, a small protein that attracts white blood cells, called CXCL10 as their payload.\n“Lung metastases deplete certain kinds of chemokines from their local environment, which means the signal that should attract beneficial white blood cells to fight the tumour is gone.\nWe hypothesised that providing that chemokine signal at the tumour site could help restore the body’s normal immune response and enable it to attack the tumors,” said co-first author Anvay Ukidve, Ph.D., a former Graduate Research Fellow at the Wyss Institute and SEAS who is now a scientist at a pharmaceutical company.\nThe team first optimised their nanoparticles to ensure that they would detach from their red blood cell hosts only when the blood cells made their tight squeeze through the lungs’ tiny capillaries.\nThey also decorated the nanoparticles’ surfaces with an antibody that attaches to a protein commonly found on lung blood vessel cells called ICAM-1 to help increase the nanoparticles’ retention in the lungs.\nThese nanoparticles were then filled with the chemokine CXCL10, creating a package the researchers named ImmunoBait.\nImmunoBait particles were then attached to mouse red blood cells to create a therapeutic delivery system named erythrocyte-anchored systemic immunotherapy (EASI), and injected into the bloodstreams of mice with breast cancer that had metastasised to their lungs.\nImmunoBait particles stayed in the animals’ lungs for up to six hours after EASI injection, and most of them were distributed in and around the metastases.\nTreatment with EASI led to strong expression of CXCL10 for up to 72 hours, suggesting that delivering the chemokine stimulated the body to start producing it on its own, despite the immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment.\nTo find out exactly what effect the delivered CXCL10 had on the mice’s immune systems, the team analysed the different types of cells present in the lungs before and after EASI injection.\nThey observed increases in the infiltration of T helper type 1 (Th1) CD4 cells, which release pro-inflammatory chemicals that help keep tumours under control, as well as effector CD8 cells and natural killer (NK) cells, which drive the direct killing of cancer cells.\nInject locally, protect globally\nArmed with evidence that their system could attract immune cells to lung metastases, the team then tested its ability to slow or halt the progression of the disease in mice.\nThey first removed the animals’ breast cancer tumours (to mimic the surgery that patients often undergo to treat their primary tumours), then injected them with either CXCL10 alone, ImmunoBait nanoparticles alone, or EASI.\nEASI inhibited the progression of lung metastasis with four-fold and six-fold greater efficacy than free CXCL10 and ImmunoBait, respectively.\nAll of the EASI-treated mice had fewer than 20 metastatic nodules after 37 days, and 25% of them had only one nodule.\nIn contrast, mice that received the other therapies had anywhere from two to 100 nodules.\nThe mice that received EASI also had nearly three-fold better survival: while animals in all the other treatment groups succumbed to their disease in less than 20 days, about 25% of the EASI-treated mice survived for 40 days.\nThey were also free of any signs of off-target toxicity or other negative effects from the treatment.\nBecause EASI effectively activated the immune system against lung metastases, the researchers wondered if that activation could provide lasting protection against future recurrences of the same cancer.\nThey analysed the blood of mice that had received EASI and observed an increased number of memory CD8 cells, which persist long-term after an immune threat and can sound the alarm if that threat resurfaces.\nTo test whether those memory cells provided sufficient protection, the team re-inoculated mice with the same tumour cells two days after their last treatment.\nMice that had been treated with EASI had significantly lower tumour growth and tumour weight than mice that were injected with saline or left untreated, demonstrating that local treatment of lung metastases produced systemic immunity against tumour development.\n“These findings highlight the ability of our EASI system to convert the biological adversity of metastasis into a unique therapeutic opportunity against metastatic cancers,” said senior author Mitragotri, Ph.D., who is also a Hiller Professor of Bioengineering and the Hansjörg Wyss Professor of Biologically Inspired Engineering at SEAS.\nHis team is continuing to optimise EASI by experimenting with delivering different types of chemokines via ImmunoBait nanoparticles, and are exploring the combination of EASI with currently approved cancer therapies to identify potential synergies.\n“This unique bioinspired approach to cancer therapy is a wonderful example of the out-of-the-box thinking that we encourage and support at the Wyss Institute – by leveraging the body’s own red blood cells to deliver drugs to capillary blood vessels of the lung where many metastases form, Samir’s team has developed an entirely new type of immunotherapy and opened the door to potentially lifesaving therapies,” said Wyss Institute Founding Director Don Ingber, M.D., Ph.D., who is also the Judah Folkman Professor of Vascular Biology at Harvard Medical School and the Vascular Biology Program at Boston Children’s Hospital, as well as Professor of Bioengineering at SEAS.",

        "Surprising Benefits Of Keto Meal Plan\nA strict diet, such as the ketogenic diet is not for everyone. The first time you get into a ketosis diet is the hardest. However, the keto diet has several benefits. Not just for weight loss but for overall health. Ketosis and the ketogenic diet have been the subject of many studies and have shown effective results. Here are some benefits of a keto meal plan that you must know about: Weight Loss\nThe ketogenic diet has been proven to be suitable for weight loss. Several studies have shown that diet has a positive effect on short and long-term weight loss. The first results can usually be noticed within a week. Unfortunately, a keto meal plan is not only fast but mainly water and stored carbohydrates. After the first weight loss, there is only fat loss. Less Appetite\nDuring the ketogenic diet, most followers experience a decrease in hunger and food cravings. This may have to do with the increase in proteins and vegetables, but also with an adaptation of the hunger hormones. The ketones that supply the brain with energy can also help reduce cravings. Improved Concentration\nFollowers of the keto lunch may experience side effects such as confusion at first, but as the diet progresses, you can experience improved concentration. When the body is in ketosis, the brain uses ketones. The improved concentration may have to do with the ketones that provide the brain with energy. Lower Insulin Level\nA low-carbohydrate diet drastically reduces high insulin levels. This is the hormone that brings glucose from the carbohydrates to the cells. Insulin is also the hormone responsible for fat storage in cells. Lowering insulin levels is seen by many as one of the main reasons this diet works so well. Less Belly Fat\nStudies show that it is a low carbohydrate diet that is effective in reducing belly fat. This is considered one of the most ridiculous parts of the body to have fat. So, if you have a big tummy, shifting to a ketosis diet is best to reduce it. Better Cholesterol Ratio\nA low-carbohydrate diet does not only offer weight loss benefits. Although the ketogenic diet is widely used for this purpose, it also has a positive effect on lowering blood sugar, blood pressure, and triglyceride levels. In addition, the diet can help increase the good HDL cholesterol and thus improve the ratio to the LDL cholesterol. Tips To Choose The Best Keto Meal Plan Delivery Services\nThousands of restaurants sell keto diets. But not all of them take care of the hygiene and health of their customers. That is why it is essential that before you order your keto meal plan from a restaurant, make sure to check all such things: The reviews of their website. Do they perform a quality check? How many ratings does their keto diet get? What’s the price of their keto diet, and can you afford it? Do the keto meal plan delivery service you have selected offer varieties in their diet plan? However, it doesn’t matter how good a keto meal they provide, if they don’t have variety, they are not good to be hired.\nSo these were some of the benefits of eating keto meals. We hope our tips help you to find the right keto meal plan delivery .",

        "Tweet +\nA vaccine created to prevent the recurrence of the deadly skin cancer melanoma is about twice as effective when patients also receive two components that boost the number and effectiveness of immune system cells called dendritic cells, according to phase 2 clinical trial results published in Nature Cancer in November.\nThese results are important because most cancer vaccine trials have failed to show clinical efficacy.\nThese results show that adding two immune-boosting components can boost the immune response for not only melanoma patients but possibly also others whose cancers express a protein called the vaccine antigen, which is common in some cancers.\nResearchers at The Tisch Cancer Institute at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, USA, working with colleagues at the National Cancer Institute-funded Cancer Immunotherapy Trials Network (CITN) based at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, USA, found that adding the small molecule Flt3L, which increases the number of dendritic cells, boosted the vaccine’s effectiveness at producing antibodies and T cells that can later fight melanoma.\nAdding a second component, called poly-ICLC, also strengthened the dendritic cells’ ability to promote antibodies as well as helper and killer T cells.\nSixty patients who had stage 2 or 3 melanoma, and whose cancer was successfully removed via surgery, received the vaccine.\nHalf of the patients received the vaccine alone while the other half received the vaccine with Flt3L and poly-ICLC.\nThe vaccine is designed to target dendritic cells and is composed of an antigen found in melanoma bound to an antibody to increase the chances of binding with dendritic cells.\nThe cocktail of the vaccine, Flt3L, and poly-ICLC nearly doubled the vaccine’s efficacy, according to analysis of the T cells detected in patients’ blood samples after they received four doses over four months.\nThat immune response was seen significantly earlier in the patients who received the cocktail and at much higher levels in many more patients compared to those who received only the vaccine.\nResearchers found antibodies were still present in blood samples tested 12 weeks after the last dose.\n“This is the first randomised clinical trial to show that an immune response to a cancer vaccine can be potentiated by the addition of Flt3L,” says Nina Bhardwaj, MD, PhD, Director of the Immunotherapy Program at The Tisch Cancer Institute, and first author and a corresponding author on the study.\n“The response was achieved because Flt3L mobilised dendritic cells, which are the gold standard in promoting cancer immunity, and improved the overall immunogenicity of the vaccine. This may change the approach of increasing efficacy in other cancer vaccines in the future.”\n“These positive results are significant not only for improving cancer vaccines, but also potentially for application to other vaccine platforms,” reported the study’s co-corresponding and senior author Steven Fling, PhD, Director of the CITN Laboratory and Senior Staff Scientist in the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, “and we are extremely grateful and indebted to the patients whose unwavering participation made this demanding clinical protocol a success.”\nThese findings also provide a basis for adding immunotherapies called checkpoint inhibitors, which have been successful in treating metastatic melanoma, to vaccines in order to further increase the success in fending off melanoma recurrence.\nResearchers also plan to follow trial participants over time and measure how many have cancer recurrence to further study the vaccine’s efficacy in each group.\n“Immunotherapy has already shown great promise for patients with metastatic melanoma who would normally have a difficult, sometimes grave, prognosis,” said Philip Friedlander, MD, PhD, Director of the Melanoma Medical Oncology Program at The Tisch Cancer Institute at Mount Sinai and site investigator of the trial.\n“It’s important to work toward developing effective cancer vaccines that can prevent cancer on their own or in addition to the drugs already available.”",

        "Posted by Lydia Hales\nThe Productivity Commission’s recommendation to replace GP mental health treatment plans with a national digital platform runs contrary to the findings of its own report, says AMA Vice President Dr Chris Moy.\nThe commission’s Mental Health Inquiry released this week said mental health treatment plans should be scrapped, and a national platform for referral and treatment built “as soon as possible”. This was one of 22 recommendations in the report, which found mental ill-health cost the Australian economy at least $220 billion per year.\nIt found GPs were not incentivised to spend enough time on mental health consults, that they were not all sufficiently culturally competent, and that some lacked mental health skills and were too dependent on medication as a treatment option.\nCreating a “a person-centred mental health system” was a key reform priority, but current mental health treatment plans showed “no evidence of having improved either GP referral practices or mental health outcomes for people”, the commissioners said.\nThey included lawyer Ms Julie Abramson; Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists Fellow Professor Harvey Whiteford; and Stephen King, an adjunct professor at Monash University whose disclosure of interest says he is married to a private practice psychologist.\nWhile community health services such as GP clinics and PHN-commissioned services were identified in the inquiry as the most common face-to-face gateways to mental healthcare, some patients faced significant barries such as wait times for appointments in regional areas, the cost and time of attending, and cultural differences between patient and practitioner.\nThe platform would become the new requirement for accessing MBS-rebated psychological therapy.\nA key part of the platform would be a tool for standardised assessment and referral, freely accessible to patients and clinicians, which would allow culturally relevant online or in-person support regardless of where the patient lived, they said.\n“The way most GPs are subsidised creates a financial incentive for them to limit their discussion time with each person, and not all GPs are competent in relating to the variety of cultural backgrounds of people who may need their help. Furthermore, while many GPs do an excellent job, some lack knowledge and skills in mental health, and rely too readily on medication as a treatment option,” the authors wrote.\n“GPs would remain a primary gateway to mental healthcare for people who have ready access to them locally and/or have physical as well as mental health concerns … With mainstream community health services (including GPs) linked to the new national digital mental health platform, people would be assured they are receiving an assessment that is rigorous and treatment recommendations that are evidence-based and match their needs.”\nDr Moy, an Adelaide-based GP, told The Medical Republic the recommendation to replace the plans with a platform was contradictory to what the report showed.\n“The bit that is really silly is that the report recognised the central importance of general practice – how we see more than all the psychologists and psychiatrists combined in terms of consultations, and there’s really good patient satisfaction – but then it talks about reducing funding by removing mental health items.\n“I think [losing mental health plans] would be a massive blow.\n“Obviously, an objective test is important and is part of it, but it’s already done – and we also need to put it in the context of the rest of the patient, which can’t be done in a machine.\n“This takes the assessment outside the GP to a great degree, and where does that continuity of care and coordination of the patient come from later? It also disregards the fact individuals who have mental health problems often have significant physical problems as well.”\nGood elements of the report included recognition of the under-funding of mental healthcare, and a focus on early prevention and diagnosis, Dr Moy said.\n“They also highlight there’s a need to look at things like housing and employment – that if people have serious illnesses and are discharged from hospital, with no community back-up, they can have major problems. They’ve also recognised that there’s a massive dearth of psychiatrists and we really need to get that funding right and look at funding other members of a multi-disciplinary team.”\nHe would have liked to see more discussion of “patient-centred medical homes” with GPs, psychologists, social workers, and mental health nurses work as an in-house team to support patients long-term.\n“Say if I had a patient who had some developing anxiety symptoms that had caused a number of problems, loss of job and finances – I could either get the mental health nurse or the psychologist involved, I could manage the medication, and then get the social worker involved to look at their home situation and get them on the path to sorting out the practical parts of life, which are going to be one of the greatest determinants of how they go.”\nDr Moy said he was pleased an inquiry has been conducted into mental health, but hoped the report is not “hijacked”.\n“It’s important that the government does not merely get hypnotised by glossy, narrow and expensive models of care which has been their tendency, and to focus on supporting what the productivity commission has identified as ‘bleedin’ obvious’: that a GP does the heavy bulk of the work at the coal face – and we need to just build on this grass roots foundation by supporting funding for a multi-disciplinary patient medical home model of care.\n“It’s been right there in front of them, but they’ve been missing the wood for the trees. This would leverage off the GPs’ knowledge of the patient to add comprehensiveness in psychiatric care of patients.”",

        "0 Comments Top Features Of Therapists Delivering Psychology Services\nWith pharmaceutical companies bombarding people with do-it-all pills, there is a common tendency to regard the popping of pills as the solution to life’s stresses and problems. The value of Bendigo psychology services in dealing with mental health issues cannot be ignored. It’s worth knowing about the top features of therapists delivering psychology services.\nResearch reveals that medication can help persons with severe depression. But drugs are not effective for mild or moderate symptoms of depression . To add to the woes, interaction with other medication and side effects can worsen patients’ problems and result in complicated health problems.\nAlso, the majority of drugs are not prescribed by experts in mental health but by physicians who prescribe drugs after 15-minute sessions with a patient without dealing with her feelings and thoughts. In addition, the costs of drugs are adding to the booming costs of health care in Australia.\nPsychotherapy is emerging as a more effective and cheaper solution to mental health problems. As per several empirical studies, psychotherapy works almost by 70 to 80% in most cases. This is an amazing statistic. Psychotherapy is also cost-effective compared to drugs with regard to accomplishing long-term life goals.\nFor psychotherapy to be effective, the professional delivering the service must have the following attributes: Inter-personal skills\nTo be effective, the psychotherapist must have the capacity for clear expression and communication. They will also be astute at sensing the feelings and thoughts of patients. While relating to clients, they display empathy, acceptance, and warmth.\nThe patient must ask the following: Is the therapist keenly interested in learning about one’s problems? Can he communicate in a language that is easy to understand? Does he focus on the patient than on his own feelings? Trust factor\nIt is a fact that people judge whether they can trust someone in the space of just 60 milliseconds. Psychotherapists can establish a trust factor for clients through verbal and non-verbal communication.\nThe client must address the following questions: Does the therapist evoke good vibes? Does he evoke the feeling that he will not betray one’s trust? Establishing of alliance\nOne of the most solid predictors of good therapeutic results is the feeling that the therapist is in partnership with the client. This is referred to as ‘therapeutic alliance. A great therapist has the capacity to form alliances with all kinds of patients.\nFor the patient, the questions are: Does the therapist stress on mutually agreeable goals? This is in spite of establishing the therapist as an expert. Adaptability\nThe therapist must be able to explain one’s symptoms and adapt explanations to varying circumstances. Clients desire to know why such symptoms are manifesting. A good therapist offers explanations that can be easily understood by clients. They are also willing to adapt as per the unfolding of the therapy.\nThe patient must ask: Can one understand the explanations offered by the therapist? Such explanations need not be ‘scientific.’ The therapy must be flexible as per changes in circumstances and when new symptoms manifest over the course of the therapy. Optimism and hope\nA great motivator for recovery from mental health issues is a sense of hope. A good therapist will establish realistic goals that engage the patient and provide a more optimistic attitude. After the reaching of goals, clients will develop confidence and resilience. This will help in all facets of life. This is why positive psychology is so effective in enhancing emotional well-being. Multi-cultural sensitivity\nA great therapist will adapt treatment as per the cultural values of clients. He will show respect for attitudes, beliefs, and differences. While working with patients, it is vital to be sensitive to issues of gender, race, sexual orientation, ethnicity, cultural background, and religion. Self-awareness\nA great therapist can distinguish between personal issues and issues of the client. Freud has identified a phenomenon called Countertransference were issues brought forth by the patient leads to an emotional reaction by the therapist. When the therapist can identify and deal with his own issues, he will be less prone to react to them while conducting therapy and help avoid any detriments to therapy.\nThe feature of self-awareness is the capacity to know how much facts must be revealed to clients. This will differ case by case. However, personal insight, professional boundaries, and capacity for empathy are very important elements. Acceptance\nIn this profession, being accepting and non- judgemental are vital attributes. The professional therapist must have the capacity to ‘begin where the client is’. This phrase is often used to imply the ability to relate to clients with a non-judgemental, open attitude of accepting the patient and her situation. The therapist must also convey this attitude of acceptance to patients with understanding and warmth. Skills of rapport building\nThe therapist must have strong skills in interaction and communication so as to build rapport with clients quickly to develop a strong relationship. He must offer undivided attention to the patient and be able to build trust. The therapist must focus on what the patient is communicating and avoid any distractions from his personal problems during the therapy session. Skills of problem-solving\nOf course, a therapist does not have the magic wand of solving problems. But he should have sufficient skills to help patients identify and adopt changes to correct negative patterns of thought.\nThese are some of the features of therapists provided by Bendigo psychology services .",

        "Researchers at Monash University and Victoria University found that ongoing micro-practices, like difficulty accessing quality facilities, poorer training times, less recognition on club’s social media and lower recognition of their successes, negatively impact women and girls in community sport.\nThe study conducted interviews and observations at a Victorian football and netball club over a six-month period, and highlights how female footballers and netball players didn’t feel fully embraced by the club, and were resentful at the lack of recognition they received.\nOne young netball player said: “Men’s footy probably comes first because it’s the most important thing in the entire league, not just the club.”\nMale football players and coaches were found to kick women players off the oval during training times, despite knowingly breaching previously agreed upon training slots and space allocations. According to the study, one male football player was observed yelling: “Why can’t the girls get off the [censored] pitch”, during a training session.\nOne of the study’s lead researchers, Associate Professor Ruth Jeanes, from the Faculty of Education at Monash University, said community sport continues to be fairly traditional, in terms of its prioritisation of men’s teams.“While participation in sport is changing through the involvement of more women and girls, the ideologies surrounding what is valued and prioritised within community sport remain fairly traditional, with the male senior teams still considered to be the most important element of the club,” Associate Professor Jeanes said.“The profile of women’s elite sport is increasing. However, this has not necessarily translated to an equalling of gender relations within community sport.“Though women and girls are more present than they have ever been in community sporting spaces, and involved in club leadership and coaching, women’s and girls’ participation is still deemed a lower priority and less important than men’s.”\nIn interviews with male committee members, it was suggested that there was no “boy’s club” mentality and the club was an inclusive space for everyone. However, women members of the club disagreed, and indicated the club remained a male-dominated space that revered “the dominant performance of masculinity”.\nAt the club, senior men’s team were given priority use of the main oval for training and matches, which was well-maintained with easy access to change rooms and the clubhouse. Women’s teams played on an oval at the rear of the clubhouse, a distance away from the change rooms and spectators.\nMany coaches at the club remarked the men’s football teams should be prioritised as they were more likely to draw crowds and sponsors.\nProfessor Ramón Spaaij from the Institute for Health and Sport at Victoria University, also a lead researcher, said more attention should be paid to the subtle ways women are marginalised at the community sport level.\n“Girls and women are less likely to continue participating in sports where they don’t feel welcome and their achievements are undervalued. This leads to issues of retention, and girls and women losing out on the numerous health and social benefits provided by community sport participation,” Professor Spaaij said.“If culture change towards full gender equity is to be achieved in community sport, more attention needs to be paid to the subtle ways in which women’s presence is marginalised or under-valued. Our study particularly shows how the allocation, use and representation of space (playing fields, clubrooms, social media) play an important role in this.” ***\nLove women’s sport?

        "Feldenkrais Method®: Everyone can improve, but who will you help? Feldenkrais Method®: Everyone can improve, but who will you help? written by The WellBeing Team ,November 18, 2020 Feldenkrais Method®\nA builder, a surfer and a dancer walk into a room. What do they have in common? These men were all facing the possibility that they would have to stop doing what they love because of pain and injury. Initially, their interest in the Feldenkrais Method was to improve their own wellbeing and longevity, but now they’re helping others improve their lives as well.\nPhil is a carpenter and martial artist. “I had a lot of old injuries as well as the stresses and strains of work,” he said. “I wanted to be able to keep working. The Practitioner Training has really brought home to me that this is my ticket to keeping a healthy body and mind into old age. The added bonus for me at 58 years of age is that I now have a new career path.”\nRoger is a surveyor and keen surfer. He had a persistent shoulder problem. “I was taking painkillers and using icepacks for two years, but worst of all was that my surfing sessions were down to 30 minutes and some days I couldn’t get out there at all,” he said. “I really enjoy learning and this is something I could stick with.”\nJulian is a dancer, musician and physical theatre performer. “Throughout my different trainings I just kept getting more and more injured,” he said. “I realised that this helps me use my whole self rather than being driven by the professional ideas of performance. Before I came to the training I could move in some nice ways, but now I have a much greater understanding of how to make that sustainable.”\nThree professional women also came into the room … a physiotherapist who specialised in helping children with developmental challenges, an occupational therapist specialising in hand problems, and a speech therapist who also works with singers and actors. They all had well-developed professional skills but recognised that they needed something more. Through participating in the Feldenkrais Training, they have discovered new ways to engage their clients in a shared journey of curiosity, trying different ways of moving and contributing to their own improvement.\nBelinda works directly with children, helping them discover the missing elements in their movement, building coordination, independence and self-confidence. She also works with their parents to support them in optimising their interactions with the children so that they can make the most of the professional input during the rest of the week at home.\nElinor had helped many people recover the use of their hands after injury or surgery, but she was frustrated that there were some people who didn’t seem to be able to let go of the tension in their arms and hands, and she couldn’t help them make progress.\nMary was already an expert in helping people with vocal pathologies, but she also wanted to be able to help singers and performers move to the next level of excellence.\nOne of the hallmarks of Feldenkrais Professional Training Programs is the diversity of the student cohort. Participants range in age from their 20s to their 80s. Their backgrounds are widely diverse and interesting. They learn with and from each other in a highly experiential setting that is well supported with resource materials and online interaction between the face-to-face components. They are encouraged to learn at their own pace and pursue their particular interests by a caring and experienced staff. Over the three-year program, they first learn to improve their own self-awareness. They move on to teaching others Awareness Through Movement and then using their hands to bring improvement to the movement and organisation of others. The Feldenkrais Institute of Australia takes pride in developing innovative teaching methods and leading the world in excellence of learning.\nThe founder of the method, Dr Moshe Feldenkrais, believes that “health is the ability to realise our avowed and unavowed dreams”. Through movement we can improve the quality of the process of what we do and how we enact ourselves. When we connect with what is important in our lives and begin to find ways to move towards it, we truly mature as human beings.\nBarbara was a housewife. After many years at home raising her children and caring for ageing parents, she wanted a career for herself. Her skills in attending to and caring for others served her well. Like her colleagues, she is now able to help people build hope and find ways to move towards joyful action. She has discovered that everyone can improve.",

        "Instagram Wearing Fitbit devices with Health2Sync glucose control app clinically proven to help both users and healthcare providers to control and better manage the symptoms of Type 2 diabetes. Health2Sync, the number one diabetes management app in Taiwan and Japan, today announced the results of their clinical study in Taiwan, demonstrating that combining Fitbit wearable devices with their Health2Sync Patient Management Platform can help users control and better manage the symptoms of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).\nIn the study[1], conducted with four of Taiwan’s leading diabetes clinics, participants recorded significant average improvements in key indicators, such as reduced HbA1C, fasting blood glucose and LDL-C, and higher blood glucose measurement frequency — a valuable proof of concept for using Fitbit wearables with diabetes care protocols and solutions.\nVoluntarily connecting their Fitbit Inspire HR with the Health2Sync App enabled study participants to let their doctors seamlessly monitor their information on the Health2Sync Patient Management Platform and provide remote consultative advice where necessary.\nThe study found:\n– Average glycated haemoglobin (HbA1C) decreased 0.33%, while patients who did moderate to high-intensity activity duration of at least 150 mins per week, saw their average HbA1C[2] decrease 0.66%– Average fasting blood glucose (BG) decreased 10.92 mg/dL– Average low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) decreased 11.55 mg/dL– Weight reduction of up to 2 kilograms among some patients– Increased frequency in moderate to high intensity activity to 7.03 times a week among some patients\nConducted over a three-month period ending in July 2020 in conjunction with the Neng-Chun Diabetes Clinic, Da-Ya Chang-An Clinic, Yier Clinic and Banqiao Da-Jun Clinic, the study, with patient consent, lets the patients’ doctors track the progress and lifestyle changes of 95 participants with T2DM. Prior to the commencement of the study, doctors at the four clinics established benchmarks for all participating patients based on blood glucose tests at the start of the trial, then on a self-monitored weekly basis throughout the study period.\nEach participant was given a Fitbit Inspire HR and the participants voluntarily agreed to connect their Fitbit wearable data with the Health2Sync diabetes management app to track their progress throughout the program. Physical activity data generated from each person’s Fitbit device was integrated into the Health2Sync app, which housed other health metrics such as patients’ HbA1c, BG and cholesterol levels. This let doctors seamlessly monitor patients’ information on the Health2Sync Patient Management Platform and provide remote consultative advice where necessary.\nDr. Kuo-Liang Lu of Da-Ya Chang-An Clinic in Taiwan, said: “The results speak for themselves. We saw a reduction in some of our patients’ weight by an average of two kilograms and fasting BG levels of study participants from Da-Ya Chang-An clinic decreased 11.10 mg/dL within 3 months[3], leading to significant health improvements.”\nDr. Neng-Chu Yu of Neng-Chun Diabetes Clinic said:\n“Type 2 diabetes, with the right lifestyle changes – medication adherence, increased activity, and better diet – can lead to major improvements in control of blood glucose levels. The integration of Fitbit data with Health2Sync let me easily view my patients’ activities and self-monitored data, enabling me to make necessary suggestions and give guidance to help patients for further improvement.”\nDiabetes is a chronic condition that, if not managed, can lead to health complications like blindness, kidney failure, heart attacks, stroke and lower limb amputation.[4] It remains the second highest cause in premature mortality, after cancer, among major non-communicable diseases in Taiwan[5] and its prevalence has posed economic burdens such as increased personal and healthcare spending and loss of work productivity.[6] A holistic approach to managing T2DM requires lifestyle changes, which includes medication adherence, exercise and proper diet. The integration with Fitbit wearable devices and activity data is key to helping to promote healthier behaviours and improve participants’ health outcomes. Participants received reminders for weekly exercises via their Health2Sync App, which promoted an increased frequency in moderate to high intensity activity at 7.03 times a week. The increased levels of activity corresponded with an improvement in patients’ health conditions. Ed Deng, CEO at Health2Sync said: “We are thrilled to see such optimistic results in the clinical study. We believe that innovations in Fitbit wearable devices and Fitbit health solutions have a major role to play in the global effort against diabetes – whether it is in reducing the onset of diabetes, or helping patients to better manage their condition – and we look forward to further expanding on our partnership with Fitbit.” Steve Morley, Vice President of International Health Solutions & General Manager of Asia Pacific at Fitbit said: “The behavioural changes exhibited by study participants reinforces our belief that Fitbit amplifies our intrinsic motivation to adopt healthier habits, which can make all the difference when dealing with a condition like Type 2 diabetes where lifestyle factors play such a big role. Together with the seamless experience that Health2Sync provides for patients and their health providers to track key indicators, they create a powerful solution that makes it simpler and more convenient to manage conditions like Type 2 diabetes.”\nIn September last year, Fitbit and Health2Sync collaborated to allow the integration of Fitbit’s health, sleep and fitness wearable data with the Health2Sync app (with user consent) to support Health2Sync’s 520,000 users in Japan and Taiwan to better manage their conditions, like Type 2 diabetes. The new platform gives users who have a Fitbit account access to an in-app dashboard that includes the option to agree to share their wearable data from their Fitbit devices[7], including heart rate, sleep and physical activity, alongside recent blood glucose readings from Health2Sync depicting if levels fall within, above, or below the healthy range.\n[1] The study was conducted on 95 participants, ages 18- 60. [2] The term HbA1c refers to glycated haemoglobin. Diabetics with higher levels of HbA1c face greater risk of developing diabetes-related complications.

        "Perrottet’s obsession with punishing public sector workers will hurt everyone November 18, 2020 Bulletins Budget - Nov 2020 (PDF version)\nIt’s just not fair.\nIn his budget speech on Tuesday, NSW Treasurer Dominic Perrottet spoke of his pride in our state. But actions speak louder than words; and the budget does nothing for the NSW public sector workers who have done so much for NSW this year.\nInstead of thanks, the budget puts a 1.5 per cent cap on public sector pay increases for the next four years. Factoring in the Federal Government’s planned superannuation increase, this equates to an annual one per cent pay rise over four years.\nThis announcement comes shortly after the Government handed out a miserly 0.3 per cent pay rise to its employees.\nThe budget proved the Government is happy to spend on projects that assist the male-dominated construction industry, but is neglecting the public service, which is more than 60 per cent female.\nPSA General Secretary Stewart Little said the budget was a sad reflection on the Berejiklian Government that relied so heavily on its workers to keep schools and government services open, contact-tracing services running and gaols COVID-free, and after PSA/CPSU NSW members were on the frontline all summer, fighting ferocious bushfires and drought.\nYour union believes the best and fairest form of pandemic economic stimulus is not in a voucher for a café, but to give the modestly paid people working for the public a fair pay rise considering their extraordinary efforts this year.\nMembers may have noticed a little extra in their pay packets recently due to a tax cut from the Federal Government. So while Canberra has tried to stimulate the economy, the NSW Treasurer has done the opposite.\nThe PSA/CPSU NSW knows public sector workers would use any extra money from the Government to invest in their local communities and small businesses. Better yet, the NSW Government might actually create new public sector jobs to assist the community and boost the economy.\nDuring 2020, it has been the everyday champions in the public sector who put their safety on the line to save our state from death and economic ruin. And even now the Treasurer’s instinct is to treat these workers like the enemy.\nThe PSA/CPSU NSW has issued a press release on its reaction to the budget. You can view the release HERE .",

The royals spend their summers on the Balmoral Estate in Scotland. (iStock)\nThe property features prominently this season, with Margaret Thatcher and Princess Diana both subjected to the royals' famous 'Balmoral test' in an early episode.\nThe 19th-century residence may be familiar to fans of historical time-travel series Outlander . Wilton House\nThis stunning centuries-old manor has landed a plum role in The Crown , providing some of the interior shots for Buckingham Palace.\nThe palace's exterior is portrayed by London's Old Royal Naval College and Moor Park Mansion. Buckingham Palace is the Queen's main residence.

Somerley House Somerley House appears in The Crown as Prince Charles' country home Highgrove. (Instagram/Somerley House)\nPrince Charles' beloved country home Highgrove House is portrayed for the first time by Somerley House, a Grade II listed Stately Home in Hampshire.\nThe beautiful property was designed in the 18th century and is not open to the public, though it is available as a wedding venue.

The real Sandringham House, where the royals usually spend Christmas. (iStock)\nSomerleyton Hall's 12-acre grounds boast a walled garden, manicured gardens and a maze, and there's a ballroom to be found inside.\nYep, we'd happily live in any one of these properties, thanks... These are the most expensive royal estates, palaces and castles",

        "Do you hear your joints creak when you go for long walks? Or do you just feel stiff when you move from sitting to standing? Well the good news is, the food you eat can help keep you limber.\nEating a balanced diet that is rich in minimally processed whole foods gives your body the tools it needs to keep your joints healthy.\nUnlike processed foods that are high in fat, sugar and salt and lack vital nutrients, minimally-processed whole foods are nutrient-rich, containing an array of antioxidants that help to manage inflammation in the body.\nWhile no single food will support your creaking joints, adding these five ingredients to your meal plan may help you maintain healthy joints over the long-term. 1. Fresh or tinned salmon\nOily fish, like salmon, are rich in omega-3 fatty acids which have anti-inflammatory properties.\nOmega-3 fatty acids have been shown to support healthy joints. The joint benefits come with 2-3 serves of salmon (150-200g) each week. 2. Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)\nEVOO contains several bioactives which are antioxidants that may help reduce inflammation in the joints.\nIncluding two or three tablespoons of EVOO is all you need to help keep your joints healthy, so why not enjoy it drizzled over your favourite salad or with balsamic vinegar to dip your sourdough in. 3. Broccoli\nJust like kale, cauliflower and brussels sprouts, kale is a cruciferous vegetable that is full of antioxidants.\nOne antioxidant in particular, sulforaphane, is released when you eat cruciferous vegetables, but particularly broccoli. This works with the enzymes that cause joint wear and tear by slowing the effects of joint niggles.\nEnjoy broccoli each day as part of your recommended five vegetable serves. 4. Turmeric\nThis yellow spice has traditionally been used in Ayurvedic Medicine as it contains an anti-inflammatory ingredient called curcumin.\nIt also has an integral role in supporting healthy liver function and relieving digestive discomfort.\nAdd turmeric to your smoothies, toss it through vegetables or fish, use it in soups or add it to your scrambled eggs. 5. Green tea\nGreen tea is packed with polyphenol antioxidants that play a role in supporting the body against free radicals, helping to keep joints happy.\nJust 3-4 cups of green tea each day is all you need to enjoy the benefits to improve your sense of wellbeing.\nNeed better moving joints?

        '9Telethon: Palliative paediatric nurse talks about her \'resilient and amazing\' patients\nDuring her sporting career Camplin suffered a range of injuries, including a broken collarbone, dislocated shoulder, broken hand, broken ribs, a ripped Achilles tendon, dislocated sternum, fractured ankles, torn knee ligaments and nine concussions — plenty of opportunities to build and practice resilience. Camplin competing during the 2006 Winter Olympics. (Corbis via Getty Images)\nThat resilience remains her secret weapon, and she has made it her business to teach others how to improve theirs.\nShe\'s created The Alisa Camplin-AIA Vitality Workplace Resilience Toolkit , which has evolved to include the unique challenges workers have face since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic in early 2020.\n"It\'s important for leaders in workplaces and families to practice good habits visibly, not just in their heads, so their colleagues see them," the athlete says.\n"You want to take them along on the journey with you." \'When I lost my son, it was one of the worst things in my life.\'\nCamplin and her family have been based in Hong Kong for the past two years for husband Oliver Warner\'s work.\n"We came here for a bit of an adventure," she says.\n"We followed my husband\'s work and thought it would be great for the family and it\'s been fabulous for us."\nTheir children Florence, six, and Felix, three, both adjusted well to the move.\n"It\'s been pretty good," Camplin says. Camplin homeschooling her children Florence, six, and Felix, three. (Instagram)\n"Kids are adaptable. They just need to feel safe and once they found friends it\'s been fabulous for them."\nThe coronavirus pandemic saw Camplin, along with parents around the world, homeschooling her children for majority of this year.\n"I\'m a working mother with my own business and I had to do a lot of prioritising through the year," she says.\n"There was a lot of pressure on me and my business, but on us as a family as well. I had to redefine success for myself and my business and really scale things to support those priorities."\nAnother major change resulting from the pandemic was Camplin\'s shift from speaking at in-person events about resilience to doing the same virtually.\n"I\'ve set up a home studio and I\'ve loved being a virtual speaker. It\'s pretty cool."\nCamplin also "doubled down" on her physical health, doing her best to "eat well, move well and think well" — something many struggled with during lockdown.\n"Having been a high performing elite sportswoman, I know what to do to get it right," she says.\n"If you are taking on too much it can become self-sabotaging." \'I\'ve set up a home studio and I\'ve loved being a virtual speaker.\' (Instagram)\nCamplin says she\'s also managed to practice flexibility, something she says is "applicable to everything", particularly for working parents.\n"There have been plenty of working parents this year put under pressure with their children," she says.\n"For me, one of the resilience factors I teach to help with this is to try and help people develop emotional awareness and emotional regulation. For anyone in any situation where they feel rising emotions and tension you need to be able to stop in the moment and go, okay, what can I control right now and what do I need to let go of."\nIf ever there was a year during which we had to accept the things we cannot control, it has been 2020.\n"The same goes for a situation at work where there is perhaps conflict," Camplin says. "You can\'t control all things, but you can control how you respond to them."\nShare your story by emailing Jo Abi at jabi@nine.com.au.',

        "November 18, 2020 Media Releases\nThe Treasurer’s ideological obsession with punishing public sector workers – even in the midst of a pandemic – is not just unethical, but economically irresponsible, according to the Public Service Association of NSW.\nWhile the budget will use record debt to invest in projects and $25 dinner vouchers, NSW public sector workers – who have delivered so much for the state this year – continue to be left out in the cold. After handing its workers a virtual pay freeze this year, the government puts a 1.5 per cent cap on public sector pay increases.\nPublic Service Association General Secretary Stewart Little said the budget was a sad reflection on the government’s irrational obsession with punishing the public sector.\n“The best and fairest form of pandemic economic stimulus would be to give the modestly paid public servants working for NSW a reward for their extraordinary eﬀorts this year,” Mr Little said.\n“Public sector workers would use any extra money from the Government to invest in their local communities and small businesses. Better yet, the NSW Government might actually create new public sector jobs to assist the community and boost the economy.\n“Instead this budget cuts public sector wages and continues to put pressure on public sector job numbers. This is woefully out of step with the economic reality.\n“Not only are these cuts an insult to the workers who have been on the front line this year, they are also an act of economic vandalism.\n“The Liberals came into government desperate to slash and punish the people who make our state run, and in nine years they’ve lost none of that initial enthusiasm.\n“The Berejiklian government loves talking about infrastructure, but the truth is no government in history has done more to damage the human infrastructure of NSW than this one.\n“Our state’s bushfire management resources are a classic example. The Government seems happy to throw some public money at shiny new trucks and equipment, but at the same time it continues to force our most experienced and knowledgeable fire experts out the door, never to return. It’s a dangerous approach that puts us all at risk.\n“During 2020, it has been the everyday champions in the public sector who put their safety on the line to save our state from death and economic ruin. And even now Dominic Perrottet’s instinct is to treat these essential workers like the enemy.”\nContact: Anil Lambert 0416 426 722",

        "AESOP PRESENTS THE SENSORY CHRONICLES Wednesday 18th November 2020 Tweet\n‘Tis the season to give the gift of Aesop. This year Aesop are paying tribute to the power of imagination with five individual kits created to embark on a fabulous journey of the senses. The Chance Companion, the Metaphysical Voyager, the Seasoned Wayfarer, the Lore Collector and the Ardent Nomad house the five sensory experiences in 100% recycled material. Loves it. Each gift kit includes a forgotten work of literature available to download as an eBook or audio file. A little extra escapism. We’re off to the land of Aesop, where life feels – and smells – quite wonderful. The gift kits are available now.\nby Roxy Lola",

The available evidence does not support the use of nicotine-containing vaping products as a smoking cessation tool. Current evidence suggests that nicotine vaping products increase the likelihood that previous non-smokers will subsequently take up tobacco smoking. Share",

        'The ‘ICU Grandpa’ who cuddles babies will melt your heart\nThe hospital celebrated Deutchman\'s work by arranging a drive-by parade outside his home, accompanied by an NICU transport truck and helicopter.\n"In 2017, the story of our \'ICU Grandpa\' touched people all over the world," the facility shared in a tweet:\nSharing more details in a Facebook post, the Atlanta health facility explained 30 cars had taken part in the parade. Some carried employees and others patients "who had been soothed by David many years ago", all honking, waving and sharing their well wishes to Deutchman\'s family as they stood in their driveway.\n"For a grand finale, a Children\'s transport helicopter circled over his home, an emotional tribute to a man who has dedicated his retirement years to watching over our kids," the Facebook post read.\nParents shared their praise for Deutchman, one writing: "He has visited with [my son] Elijah many times over the past six years and would even stop by on our various ICU admits since."\n"He was always so thoughtful to our family. Thank you so much for being our rock through the most difficult challenge in our lives," shared another.\nDeutchman\'s story became a global headline in 2017 when a photo of him cradling a tiny patient circulated the internet.\nHe shared his love of his volunteer role, which he took up following a life-long career in International business marketing.\n"There are a lot of benefits to that warm connection of being held — when a baby puts their face against your heartbeat, there\'s a benefit there," Deutchman told PEOPLE at the time.\n"I came to love it, but not just because of the connection with the babies, but the whole atmosphere of the hospital."\nOn Tuesdays, Deutchman would cuddle babies whose parents were unable to be with them, and volunteered in the NICU on Thursdays each week.\nDeutchman would also provide support to the mothers of newborns by holding and caring for their children while they ate breakfast.\nHe is reportedly survived by Ronnie, his wife of 58 years, daughters Susan Lilly and Jill Deutchman, and his grandchildren and great-grandchildren.\nFor a daily dose of 9Honey, sign up here to receive our top stories straight to your inbox',

        "While the physical repercussions of cancer are often the first thing that comes to mind following a diagnosis, it’s crucial not to underestimate the importance of psychosocial support when it comes to treatment. For mental health specialists, treating someone with cancer can be unfamiliar territory. Treating a child with cancer can be particularly so.“The older the child, the more impact the diagnosis,” says psychotherapist, Dr Karen Phillip.“While many children have heard of the word cancer, they often connect it to something bad, painful, causing death or great illness, and often relate it to older people.“The psychological impact can be immense.” Children experience a wide range of emotions, many of which they don’t understand themselves. “Concern, confusion and fear, however, not always for themselves, but for their parents who may appear worried, frightened and upset.“The child may feel responsible for their family’s distress.“The child may fear death, and not being able to enjoy their life, friends and activities.“They may become angry this illness is affecting them.” Dr Phillip says children often express their emotions in different ways. Some might speak about how they feel honestly, while others are confused about the emotions they are feeling.“And others can become angry at their body, at the medical treatment because it’s making them sick, or not curing them.“Some kids feel fear and anger because they are separated from family and friends during treatment.” Emotions also differ considerably with the age of the child, says Dr Phillip. A young child or toddler has limited understanding of mortality and may accept their condition, but might be distressed by the treatment. Whereas a child aged between four to 11 years often has a better understanding and may require reassurance about their future. “The teenager is often more informed and understands mortality much better,” says Dr Phillip.“This age group is where we see a higher degree of emotions expressed.” The importance of psychosocial support is increasing, with most hospitals now employing a number of mental health experts as standard treatment.“What the mind believes the body responds to, therefore, it is essential we do all we can to keep the child feeling safe, positive, with a strong drive to survive and recover; even if the parent is feeling fearful or negative.“Our brain is our most powerful organ.“Combining positive mindset with the latest treatments can have wonderful long-lasting results, they need to go hand in hand for best outcome.” Despite the difficult circumstances, Dr Phillip says it’s important to engage children’s imagination in a positive way, as much as possible.“Depending on the age of the child, the degree of illness and the attitude of parents and medical staff, the child may welcome psychosocial support or be resistant.“Nothing is over until it is over and while the child is surviving, we must remain positive and this may positively influence their belief as well.“When discussing upcoming treatment, therapists should be honest with the child, while at the same time, painting a clear, positive picture of what is to come in their life.“Make sure you paint the picture for their active imagination using all senses so they can see what they see, hear what they hear and feel what they feel. Children, like adults, have a range of emotions, however children may not understand what they’re feeling, or be able to label their emotions like adults can.“There are some wonderful supports set up for kids and families however not all families are able to access them.“The more support we can provide the children plus the families going through this traumatic situation, the better outcome for all.” Related Articles",

        "Zebrafish are helping University of Queensland scientists discover how sound processing impacts people with autism spectrum disorder and Fragile X syndrome. The tiny fish carry the same genetic mutations as humans with both conditions, allowing researchers to discover the neural networks and pathways that produce the hypersensitivities to sound in both species. A team of scientists from UQ studied how zebrafish made sense of their world, in order to explore how neurons work together to process information. Fragile X syndrome is caused by the disruption of one gene, so researchers were able to disrupt that single gene in zebrafish and observe the effects. Half of males and one fifth of females with Fragile X syndrome also meet the diagnostic criteria for autism spectrum disorder. Queensland Brain Institute’s Dr Lena Constantin said loud noises often caused sensory overload and anxiety in people with autism and Fragile X syndrome. “Sensitivity to sound is common to both conditions,” she said.“We think the brain is transmitting more auditory information because it is not being filtered and adjusted as normal.” As part of the study, Dr Constantin said the team recorded the brain activity of zebrafish larvae whilst showing them movies or exposing them to bursts of sound.“The movies simulate movement or predators —the reaction to these visual stimuli was the same for fish with Fragile X mutations, and those without,” Dr Constantin said.“But when we gave the fish a burst of white noise, there was a dramatic difference in the brain activity in Fragile X model fish.” After seeing how the noise radically affected the fish brain, the team designed a range of 12 different volumes of sound. Testing found that the Fragile X model fish could hear much quieter volumes than the control fish.“The fish with Fragile X mutations had more connections between different regions of their brain,” said Dr Constantin.“And their responses to the sounds were more plentiful in the hindbrain and thalamus,” Dr Constantin said. Using the zebrafish, scientists have been able to see significantly more detail, and for the first time, witness more activity in the hindbrain, an area Dr Constantin said they’d like to explore further.“We hope that by discovering fundamental information about how the brain processes sound, we will gain further insights into the sensory difficulties faced by people with Fragile X syndrome and autism,” she said. The research was published in BMX Biology and funded by the Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative, National Health and Medical Research Council and Australian Research Council.

        "Low levels of contamination with N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) 18 November 2020\nThe TGA began investigating the potential contamination of Australian metformin medicines with N -nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) in late 2019.\nRecently, TGA's laboratories completed testing a selection of immediate- and extended-release metformin medicines for the presence of NDMA. This found that approximately 30% of batches contained levels of NDMA that modestly exceed the acceptable limit (less than twice the limit). One batch was found to have higher levels (4.4‑times the limit). Only limited stock of this batch has been supplied, and it has now been recalled from wholesalers.\nMetformin is an important treatment for diabetes. The risks from not treating diabetes are far greater than the risks posed by the levels of NDMA seen to date.\nThe TGA has carefully considered the risk for patients from batches that modestly exceed the limit. This included an analysis of the commonly prescribed doses of metformin using data from the general practice program MedicineInsight . Overall, the risk is considered to be very low for patients on both immediate- and extended-release products. The TGA investigation indicates that the majority of patients would not be exposed to levels of NDMA that exceed the acceptable intake limit.\nThe limits set by the TGA for NDMA are very conservative. They are calculated to ensure that an individuals' excess cancer risk would not exceed 1:100,000 if that individual was on the maximum daily dose of the medicine for 70 years. As most individuals do not take the maximum daily dose, and are not using metformin for this long, the risks are very low.\nThe TGA is continuing to work with the sponsors of metformin medicines to ensure that this critical medicine remains available, and that consumers are not exposed to unacceptable levels of NDMA. The TGA is also working with medicine manufacturers to oversee the implementation of improved manufacturing and testing processes that will ensure that metformin medicines supplied in Australia meet our high standards for quality.\nConsumers are strongly advised to continue to take their metformin medicines as prescribed.

It was last seen on Queen Elizabeth in 1953. (Royal Collection Trust)\nAlthough he may not choose to be known as King Charles III, instead the new king might prefer to use one of his other given names, such as Philip or Arthur or George.\nBut one thing is for certain: Charles will wear the St Edward's Crown during his coronation.\nIt was made for Charles II in 1661, as a replacement for the medieval crown which had been melted down in 1649 by the Parliamentarians, according to the Royal Collection Trust.\nThe original was thought to date back to the 11th Century royal saint, Edward the Confessor – the last Anglo-Saxon king of England. The coronation of Queen Elizabeth II at Westminster Abbey on June 2, 1953. (Syndication International)\nThe crown was commissioned from the Royal Goldsmith, Robert Vyner, in 1661.\nAlthough it is not an exact replica of the medieval design, it follows the original in having four crosses-pattée and four fleurs-de-lis, and two arches.\nIt is made of a solid gold frame set with semi-precious stones, including rubies, amethysts, sapphires, garnet, topazes and tourmalines.\nBetween 1661 to the early 20 th Century, the crown was adorned with hired gems which were returned to jewellers after the coronation.\nBut in 1911, the crown was permanently set with semi-precious stones for the coronation of George V.\nThe crown has a velvet cap with an ermine band.\nSt Edward's Crown is part of the Crown Jewels and is kept at the Tower of London.
