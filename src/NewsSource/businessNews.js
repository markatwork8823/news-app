        "Horrific allegations of Australian war crimes released\nThe 'deeply disturbing' details of Australian war crimes in Afghanistan have been made public. The ‘special’ treatment that bred alleged killers Ian McPhedran , news.com.au November 19, 2020 6:30pm\nCOMMENT\nWhen defence chief General Angus Campbell fronted the media in Canberra on Thursday morning to release the explosive report into the war crimes committed by Australian soldiers in Afghanistan, he was clearly devastated by what had been uncovered.\nOperators from the Perth based Special Air Service Regiment, the nation’s most elite army unit, had committed acts of such brutality and depravity that the details were judged too gruesome to reveal and were heavily redacted.\nBut as any defence correspondent could tell you, “specials” have always been treated differently.\nJournalists visiting the Australians in Afghanistan soon saw that the SAS base at Camp Russell in Tarin Kowt was a padlocked and razor-wired headquarters within a headquarters. It was off-limits to anyone outside the “specials”, its exclusive status marked by a large “no photographs” sign on the wall.\nIt was never difficult to recognise a “special” individual. All infantry soldiers must shave every day, but the “specials” could swagger about with beards flowing as they retired to their secret HQ to enjoy non-military meals prepared by their own chef and a good supply of alcohol that was banned elsewhere.\nAccording to the Brereton report, the SAS troops also acquired exotic ammunition and hand grenades that were off limits to Australian forces.\nPut simply, “specials” have always been just that – led to believe they were special and the normal rules did not apply.\nRELATED: Unspeakable act ‘utterly disgraceful’ media_camera SAS troops also acquired exotic ammunition and hand grenades that were off limits to Australian forces. Picture: Department of Defence\nAnd while the report clears the nation’s political leaders of any direct culpability, saying, “[I]t was not a risk to which any government, of any persuasion, was ever alerted. Ministers were briefed that the task was manageable. The responsibility lies in the Australian Defence Force,” it does include a thinly veiled warning.\nThat warning, for the politicians who send Australians to war and deployed the SAS continuously for more than a decade, was as follows: “Special Forces should not be treated as the default ‘force of first choice’ for expeditionary deployments, except for irregular and unconventional operations.”\nSimilar warnings were issued as far back as 2004 by then SAS commander and now army chief Lieutenant General Rick Burr and then Special Operations commander Major General Duncan Lewis. But they have not been heeded.\nToday, the details of what has played out over the past years trickled out in the heavily-redacted report. We learnt that some troops made covering up their crimes into an art form. They even took along props known as “throwdowns”, carrying weapons or radios in their backpacks to plant on their victims’ bodies, to make the innocent appear guilty in a campaign of deception that even ran to falsified patrol reports. These reports should be the reliable first draft of war history, but they contained lies.\n“Operation summaries and other reports frequently did not truly and accurately report the facts of engagements,” the report says.\nNothing was apparently off-limits to the gang of SAS cowboys (mostly Corporals and Sergeants). media_camera 39 people are dead as a result of ‘unlawful’ actions of soldiers. Picture: Department of Defence\nThe extraordinary report, compiled by Army Reserve Major General and NSW Justice Paul Brereton, makes for shocking reading, even with large swathes blacked out.\nBrereton and his team conducted 510 witness interviews and reviewed 20,000 documents and 25,000 images.\nGeneral Campbell had read every unredacted word and they weighed heavily on him.\nAs a former SAS officer, he understands the damage this scandal has inflicted upon the Regiment and Special Operations Command.\nThe alleged murder of 39 non-combatants by 19 individuals, in clear breach of the laws of war and the rules of engagement, has forever stained the reputation and the good works done by thousands of Australian military personnel during the Afghan campaign.\nAt the press conference General Campbell was blunt about his intention to bring to justice any and all involved in the scandal. His first target was the Number Two SAS Squadron that has been removed from the army’s order of battle (ORBAT). That squadron and other SAS units embroiled in war crimes will also have their unit awards revoked. Many individual SAS officers and soldiers will suffer the same fate.\nThe unprecedented removal of a squadron from the ORBAT is the first step in a major reshaping of the SAS Regiment to ensure there is no repeat of the Afghanistan experience.\nThe next phase in this unprecedented saga will be the gathering of evidence by a Special Prosecutor for possible legal action against 19 individuals.\nThat job could take years.

        "Don’t bag horse: James Cummings leaps to defence of Cascadian Clinton Payne , News Corp Australia Sports Newsroom November 19, 2020 5:29pm\nGodolphin trainer James Cummings won’t hear of Cascadian’s credibility being questioned ahead of the import’s next start in Saturday’s $1 million The Gong (1600m) at Kembla.\nWhen discussing his Saturday runners — I put to the trainer that Cascadian’s inability to register more than two wins from 15 since arriving in Australia has him ‘knocking on the door to join Kementari and Avilius as punting undesirables with flashy looks’.\n“What’s he done wrong this prep,” Cummings said. “They can’t all win all the time at the top level.\n“We haven’t missed him — (PB) Lawrence (Stakes), Memsie (Stakes), (Sir) Rupert Clarke (Stakes), Toorak (Handicap), Cantala (Stakes).\n“Which one should he have won?\n“He chased solidly first-up in the Lawrence behind a perfectly suited stablemate, ran on strongly in the Memsie out wide, too short, beaten two and a bit lengths behind Group 1 winners during the spring.\n“Gone to the line untested in the Rupert Clarke.\n“Some doubted him because of his run in the Toorak but he was four wide from about the half-mile, off balance on the turn — that’s what happens.\n“Once he got through the emergencies he came out of barrier 14 of 16 in the Cantala.\n“The horse he beat in the race (Rock) had barrier two, our horse charged home out wide, he’s gone close and Damien Oliver comes in and says ‘nothing took me into the race’ and he got beaten a half-neck.\n“Big effort. That’s why I’ll defend him.” media_camera Oh so close for Cascadian in the Group 1 Cantala Stakes. Picture: Getty Images\nCummings says the Cantala Stakes form is “the right form” for The Gong and Cascadian will be ridden on Saturday by Nash Rawiller.\n“We wouldn’t have him here unless we are expecting another good performance,” he said.\nAnother horse heading to The Gong with Group 1 form is the stablemates Asiago and Best Of Days.\nAsiago is on the back-up after last Saturday contesting the $1 million The Hunter where she worked home strongly while Best Of Days also comes out of the Cantala Stakes, just like Cascadian.\n“Asiago let down beautifully in The Hunter and the mile will allow her to race more comfortably,” he said\n“The horse has had two runs this preparation where she has never got out and that has left her with plenty of stored energy to come here at the top of her game this deep into a campaign.\n“I’m pleased with the horse and how she came through last Saturday and I’m delighted with the way she’s been racing.\n“This could be an extremely rewarding effort from her if she is capable of mixing with these horses at 1600m. media_camera Asiago will be right at home at the mile. Picture: Getty Images\n“Best Of Days was excellent first-up so much so there was lots of interest in the horse when produced second-up in the Moonga (Plate) and if I had my time over again I wouldn’t have run him on the wet track.\n“Perhaps it takes him a bit of time to get over a run like that.\nHe sort of just chased in the Cantala but he didn’t get beaten nine lengths, he got beaten less than four, he’s improved and he’s worthy of his chance here.\n“This day last year he was enormous in the Railway. If he runs to his pattern, expect something.” media_camera Golden Eagle-winning jockey Koby Jennings teams up with Best Of Days. Picture: Getty Images\nCummings said in just two short years The Gong has this year produced a classy field highlighted by the fact that Asiago rose four benchmark ratings points for her third placing in The Hunter but she still remains on the limit weight of 52kg on Saturday.\n“This is a genuine Group 1 standard race,” he said. “This is as better race that the Stradbroke was, tell me it’s not?\n“The ratings tell you. The top-rated horse is 110 (benchmark) rater and a horse on the minimum is at 98, technically it would be 94 if it was a male.”\nCascadian is the shortest runner of the Godolphin trio in the betting markets at $11 ahead of Asiago at $13 with Best Of Days a $35 chance.\nKathy O’Hara rides Asiago while Golden Eagle-winning jockey Koby Jennings teams up with Best Of Days.\nMORE RACING",

        "Close Hazlewood: Night test has to be in Adelaide\nCricket: Australian fast bowler Josh Hazlewood isn't phased if the first Test against India is moved to a different venue but believes the pink ball test must be played in Adelaide. Test star Nathan Lyon says he’s only getting better as he prepares to tackle India Russell Gould , NCA NewsWire November 19, 2020 6:01pm\nAussie Test star Nathan Lyon has set himself a target of more than 500 wickets as he edges towards his 100th match in the baggy green.\nLyon is set to become just the 10th player in Australian history to reach 100 Tests in the fourth and final match against India in Brisbane in January.\nHe has racked up 390 wickets in his 96 Tests, already the most by any Australian off-spinner.\nBut Lyon, who turns 33 on Friday, declared he was still getting better and said 500 wickets was “definitely on the radar”.\n“I still feel I‘m getting better and still feel like i’ve got a lot of cricket to offer Cricket Australia,”he said on Thursday in a live Q&A yesterday with News Corp readers.\n“Definitely 500 and beyond is on my radar.”\nLyon has proven himself to be a nemesis for the best batsman in the world, dismissing Indian captain Virat Kohli seven times in Tests, more than any other bowler. The GOAT is ready for 500 and then plenty more after that! pic.twitter.com/LsKE3KP1In — News Cricket (@NewsCorpCricket) November 19, 2020\nHe remains the frontline Test spinner for Australia, but will be joined in the 17-man squad by Queensland leggie Mitch Swepson, who took 23 wickets in three Sheffield Shield matches to emerge as the next in line.\nLyon said spin bowling in Australia was “progressing”.\n“I think it‘s a craft we can’t afford to rush certain individuals. It’s a craft you learn and you keep learning and you get better with age,” he said.\nLyon snared nine wickets in his three games for NSW, his only red-ball cricket since the final Test against New Zealand way back in January.\nHe said the COVID-19 enforced break had only increased his motivation to get back to doing what he does bets.\n“Probably it’s driven my love for the game,” Lyon said.\n“Without being able to play the game that you love so much and not being able to play that regularly that’s driven my passion to get out there and that hunger to perform well again.\n“The most I’ve missed is that pressure that comes along with playing Test cricket. Missing that adrenaline.”\nLyon will continue to train with NSW during the limited over series against India which starts on November 27, before linking up with his Test teammates.",

        'Late storms prompt grain moisture warning 19 Nov 2020, 3 p.m. Aa GRDC research engineer Ben White said high moisture grain, in storage, can increase in temperature rapidly without aeration. PATCHY storm rain is adding to harvest stress across parts of Western Australia as growers work around the clock to get crops off and those challenges can be exacerbated if harvesting high moisture grain. Grains Research and Development Corporation\'s (GRDC) Stored Grain Extension Team research engineer Ben White said to avoid delivery or storage quality problems, growers needed to act quickly once high moisture grain was harvested. "Grain respires like most living organisms, which means it takes in oxygen to use with carbohydrates, which in turn generates carbon dioxide, water and heat," Mr White said. "When grain has a high moisture content and is warm, the rate of respiration increases significantly, causing it to heat. "High moisture grain in storage can increase in temperature rapidly without aeration and this can result in serious grain damage or \'bin burn\' and creates ideal conditions for moulds and insect pests." In situations where growers need to harvest early and temporarily store high moisture grain, it is critical they have aeration cooling, as well as clear plans to dry grain or blend grain within three to five weeks. "In most cases, grain can be safely held for a few weeks at 14 to 16 per cent moisture content with the temporary measure of having small aeration cooling fans running continuously, delivering airflows of at least two to four litres per second per tonne (2-4L/s/t)," Mr White said. "Options for managing high moisture grain depends on the equipment available, but it is important to understand it is very difficult to reliably reduce moisture content using standard small aeration cooling fans (output 2-4 L/s/t) designed for cooling grain, not drying." To keep grain cool, aeration fans should be run continuously as soon as the first truck load of moist grain goes into a silo or shed and ideally, a silo with aeration ducting that provides effective air distribution through wet grain should be used. Silos with a wide base may require at least two fans opposite each other and the silo roof vents or the top silo lid needs to be open enough to ensure airflow is not restricted. Mr White said growers should consider only filling two-thirds of the silo to reduce the grain depth and effectively increase air flow. "Do twice daily checks on grain temperature, check silo fan operation and smell the grain at the top of the silo. "If available, use an automatic aeration controller set on \'auto continuous\', this automatically turns the fan off for a short time when air exceeds 85pc relative humidity. "If manually operating fans, growers should monitor the ambient temperature and relative humidity on-farm and if the weather is wet and humidity is consistently above 85pc, they should turn off fans for short periods of two to four hours." Growers need to regularly check grain temperature with the aim of keeping it below 25 degrees Celsius, remembering it is the average relative humidity of the air they are using while fans are running that is important. Short run periods for one to two hours of high humidity air during a rainstorm should not cause problems, provided this is promptly followed by lower average relative humidity air. "Turning grain could be considered - after two to four days of having wet grain in the silo, auger the grain into a truck, then back into a silo," Mr White said. "Moving grain around and turning it over helps to break up hotspots that can develop in a silo, this may be helpful if the aeration air distribution system/ducting is limited."',
